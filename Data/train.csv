Phillip,

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.


Sincerely,


Greg Thorse",corporate,Yes

Subject: RE: Interesting find - mathematical principles in Meiji-era art

David,

I'm thrilled that you're as enthusiastic about this discovery as I am! I've attached images of the painting and a brief summary of my initial findings. As you'll see, the arrangement of the motifs follows a specific geometric pattern that seems to be based on trigonometric principles.

While this particular painting is the most striking example I've found so far, I believe the use of mathematical principles in Japanese art and design during the Meiji era was more widespread than previously thought. I've come across several other examples that suggest a growing interest in incorporating geometric and mathematical concepts into artistic compositions during this period.

I think this discovery could have significant implications for our understanding of the cultural and intellectual exchanges between Japan and the West during the Meiji era. It may also shed light on the ways in which Japanese artists and designers were adapting and integrating new ideas from the West while maintaining a distinct cultural identity.

I'm excited to discuss this further and explore the potential for collaboration. I think we could develop a compelling joint publication that combines our expertise in art history and mathematics to shed new light on this fascinating aspect of Japanese art and culture.

Please let me know your thoughts on the attached materials, and if you have any suggestions for further research or analysis.

Best regards,
Akiko",research,No

Hi Michael,

The real-world problem-solving strategy you mentioned sounds fascinating! In fact, I recently attended a seminar where the presenter shared some compelling research on the effectiveness of this approach in promoting higher-order thinking skills and engagement.

I have a few articles and case studies that might be of interest to you. I'll send them your way shortly.

You know, I've been thinking about how we could collaborate on this. What if we both implemented the real-world problem-solving strategy in our classrooms and collected data on its impact? We could compare our findings and even consider writing a paper together about our experience.

Let me know what you think! I'm excited about the possibility of working together on this project.

Subject: Exciting opportunity for collaboration

Hi Jordan,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we connected, but I wanted to reach out because I think you might be interested in a new project we're working on at RenewableTech.

We're in the early stages of developing a new geothermal power plant in the Cascades region of the Pacific Northwest. As you know, this area has significant geothermal potential, and we believe it's an ideal location for a large-scale geothermal energy project.

Given your extensive research on the geological characteristics of the Cascades and their implications for geothermal energy production, I think your insights could be incredibly valuable to our team. I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing potential collaboration opportunities, either as a consultant or a research partner.

If you're open to the idea, I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss the project in more detail and answer any questions you might have. Let me know your thoughts!

Subject: RE: Satire and Social Change

Ananya,

Great to hear from you! I've been meaning to email you as well. Your lecture on the Telangana movement was fascinating, and I've been thinking about the parallels between political satire and grassroots activism ever since.

I'd be happy to share some thoughts on satire and social change for your book. In my experience, humor has the power to cut through political rhetoric and speak to people's shared values and experiences. By holding up a mirror to society's absurdities, satirical fiction can inspire people to question the status quo and push for change.

As for my new novel, it's been a wild ride so far. The more I delve into the commercialization of holidays, the more I realize how deeply it reflects our society's priorities and values. It's a rich vein of material, to say the least.

I'm also excited to explore the city and connect with the local literary community. If you have any recommendations for writers' groups or book clubs, I'd be grateful for the introduction.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration!

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Alex,

Thank you so much for your thoughtful response and for all of the great suggestions! I really appreciate you taking the time to brainstorm with me and am excited to explore these ideas further. 

The visual storytelling and theater concepts sound especially promising, and I'd love to connect with the organization you mentioned to learn more about their approach. Similarly, the music ideas are fascinating - I've seen some of those vibration-based programs and think they could be really impactful for our kids.

Getting family involvement will be key, you're absolutely right. I'm hoping this program can be a way to help the students' families feel more connected to the school community as well.

I'll definitely take you up on that offer for a letter of support, that would be hugely helpful for the grant application. I'll send over the details and a draft of the proposal early next week.

And yes, I'd love to grab coffee sometime soon! It would be great to meet in person and for you to introduce me to some of your colleagues. Just let me know when works well for you.

Thank you again for all of your support and enthusiasm. I'm really looking forward to working together!

Phillip,

The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions
with the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your
approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the
application.

We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's
decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in
time with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners
""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to
achieve this, we will have the following constraints:
   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's
   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and
   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous
   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In
   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw
   gas. What you should have done was...""
   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the
   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences
   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to
   start over at time period one.
   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,
   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right
   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the
   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any
   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and
   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually
   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already
   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and
   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we
   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with
   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this
   task.

We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework
does not support the downloading of data into external applications. The
technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current
development budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner
on the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the
mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.

If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day
Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this
simulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let
me know if you would like to set up a meeting.

Thank you.
Mery

I couldn't agree more about strengthening the conclusion. Let's schedule a call this week to brainstorm some ideas for tying our findings to the broader debates in the field. I'm confident that with a little more work, this paper will be ready to submit to the journal.

And thank you for your kind words about our collaboration. I feel the same way - it's been wonderful to have a partner in this project who understands the challenges of balancing academic and family life.

Your enthusiasm is contagious! I'm so excited to see all these fantastic activities come to life. The students are going to have a blast, and I'm sure their families will appreciate the effort we've put into creating a fun and educational event.

I'll start gathering materials for the creative writing and bookmark-making stations right away. I have some great ideas for prompts and supplies that will spark the students' creativity.

During our next meeting, let's discuss the logistics of setting up the ""book swap,"" ""story walk,"" and ""costume corner."" We can also finalize the event schedule and make sure we have all the necessary resources and volunteers.

I'm so grateful to have you as my colleague and collaborator, Emily. Your structured approach and dedication to immersive learning are truly inspiring. I can't wait to see the impact this event will have on our students' love for reading and writing.

George,

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for reaching out about the Environmental Justice course. I'm glad to hear you're enthusiastic about this collaboration. I agree that it's important for us to find a balance between theory and application in the course content.

I've been thinking about how we can incorporate case studies and real-world examples to help students see the practical implications of the theories we'll be discussing. I have a few ideas for topics and readings, but I'd love to hear your suggestions as well.

As for our teaching styles, I know we have some differences in our approaches. I think it could be beneficial for us to have a conversation about how we can complement each other's strengths and find a way to create a cohesive learning experience for our students.

I'm happy to meet next Wednesday afternoon to discuss our plans further. Let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer.  some examples are  strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical  analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
  weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just     subscribe to  a weather 
service
  storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
  production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad     commission 
reports)
  end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage.  
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty

John, 
Thanks a million for your input.
I was wondering if you could outline some good responses to these questions.

With your interpretation of a good response, or points to consider, this will 
be a great resource for other interviewers.

Thanks again,

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: RE: Memory Management System Update

Hi Alex,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad to know that the project at TechSavvy is moving forward. Regarding the cache performance issue, I think non-uniform cache architectures could indeed be a viable solution. I've done some research on the topic, and I believe it could help alleviate the bottlenecks you're experiencing.

I can share some papers and resources that might be useful for your implementation. Let's schedule a call this week to discuss it in more detail.

As for the research paper, I'm excited to see your outline! I've been reviewing the data as well, and I think we have a strong case for the benefits of our proposed memory management techniques. If you can send me your outline, I'll provide my feedback and suggestions.

It's been a while since we caught up, so I'd love to hear more about your new role at TechSavvy. Are you enjoying it so far?

Looking forward to our call and collaborating on the paper!

Best,

Emily,

Thanks so much for sending over those project ideas! I've had a chance to look through them and I think they're great. The idea of using Arduino to teach concepts like graphing linear equations and exploring trigonometric functions is really exciting.

I'm definitely interested in collaborating on a workshop proposal for the STEM Educators Conference. I think we could put together something really compelling that showcases the potential of Arduino in both math and electronics education. I'll start brainstorming some potential project ideas and will send them your way for feedback.

In the meantime, I'd love to try out some of the projects you sent with my students. I'll let you know how it goes and will be sure to send along any suggestions for improvements.

Thanks again for reaching out!

Emily,

Inviting Prof. Gupta to give the keynote speech is an excellent idea! He's been a guiding light in our academic journey, and it would be wonderful to have him celebrate this milestone with us.

I'll start putting together a list of artifacts for the exhibition. We should also consider creating a small catalog to accompany the exhibition, with photographs and descriptions of the pieces. It could be a nice keepsake for the attendees.

I've heard back from the Asian Art Museum, and they have a few dates available in mid-September. I'll send you the options, and we can decide which one works best for us.

Thanks for all your hard work on this, Emily. I couldn't ask for a better co-author and friend to share this journey with.

Naomi,

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I was just browsing through the latest issue of the Journal of Dermatological Research and noticed a call for proposals for a special issue on ""Innovations in Skin Cancer Treatment and Prevention."" I immediately thought of our conversations about collaborating on a project related to our overlapping interests.

What do you think about submitting a proposal for an article that highlights some of the cutting-edge technologies and preventive strategies we've been discussing?

Jordan,

April 20th at 1:30 PM works perfectly for me. I'll make sure to focus my presentation on the basics of geothermal energy, its applications, and its potential for the future. I'm confident that the students will find the topic engaging and inspiring.

The audiovisual setup you described should be more than sufficient for my needs. I'll bring my laptop and a few handouts to supplement my presentation.

Subject: Reaching out about functional programming in marine biology

Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the interdisciplinary research conference last month. I really enjoyed our conversation about the parallels between our fields, and I've been thinking about how I could incorporate some of the functional programming concepts you mentioned into my work on whale migration patterns.

I'm writing to ask if you'd be open to chatting more about this. I'm particularly interested in learning how to use functional programming to process and analyze the large datasets I work with, and I'd love to get your insights on best practices and resources for learning. If you're up for it, I'd be happy to buy you a coffee or lunch to pick your brain!

Hi Emily,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad my presentation resonated with you. I've definitely considered the linguistic aspects of respiratory conditions, but haven't had the opportunity to explore it in depth. It would be fascinating to see how language use might vary based on different medical factors. I'd be happy to discuss this further and see if we might be able to collaborate on a project.

Let me know if you'd like to set up a call to brainstorm ideas.

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our climate change series and wanted to touch base with you about the progress so far. I've finished the draft for the first article on the potential health impacts of climate change, and I think it's shaping up nicely. I'd love to get your feedback on it before we move forward.

Also, I was wondering if you've had a chance to start working on the economics piece? I know you've been swamped with other projects lately, so no worries if you haven't had the time yet. If you need any help or want to brainstorm ideas, just let me know.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and catching up soon!

Subject: New study on the safety of Tdap vaccine during pregnancy

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share with you a new study I came across that provides further evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy. The study, published in the Journal of Obstetric Medicine, followed a large cohort of pregnant women who received the Tdap vaccine and found no increased risk of adverse outcomes for either the mother or the baby.

I think this information could be valuable to include in the pamphlet we're working on. What do you think about updating our current recommendations to strongly encourage expectant mothers to receive the Tdap vaccine during their third trimester, as per the study's findings?

Let me know your thoughts, and if you have any other suggestions for the pamphlet.

Jennifer asked me to explain about the effect of the refinery fire.

The St. Croix refinery has their reformer offline.  The reformer is used to 
convert straight-run naphtha into a high octane blending component called 
reformate as well as some butane and lighter gases.  The effect would not 
really be a reduction in gasoline, but a reduction in a high quality blending 
component which would make it harder to make RFG.

As of this writing, the fire is out. If you have any further questions, feel 
free to contact me.

John -

I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.

I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

- Mike

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present
opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other
ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd
listen.

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

Subject: RE: Reaching out for your expertise

Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad my research resonated with your current project. The long-term health impacts of the Civil War on children is a fascinating topic, and I'd be happy to share my thoughts and insights.

I recently published a study that found a significant correlation between early puberty and socioeconomic status, which could indeed be relevant to your work. The stress and hardships experienced by children during times of economic instability and war can certainly have lasting effects on their physical development and overall health.

I'm available for a video call next Friday, April 14th, at 10 am EST if that works for you. Alternatively, we could have an email exchange if you prefer. Let me know what suits you best.

Looking forward to our discussion and learning more about your book project.

Best,

Lucy,


You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on 
Labor.

Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):

1.  Check 1406  Walmart    Description and unit?

2.  Check 1410  Crumps     Detail description and unit?

3.  Check 1411  Lucy      What is this?

Subject: RE: Great meeting you at the conference!

Hi Jamie,

I'm glad you're interested in writing about our new project! I'll keep you posted on our progress and will definitely share some results with you once we have something solid. 

As for your question about science and policy, I could write a whole book on that topic. One example that comes to mind is the debate over hydraulic fracturing (fracking). There's a lot of really good scientific evidence that fracking can cause earthquakes, but the industry keeps trying to downplay or deny that risk. It's frustrating to see decision-makers ignoring or cherry-picking the science like that.

I'd be happy to talk more about this with you, either over email or in person if you're ever in town. I'm actually going to be at a conference in Seattle next month - any chance you'll be there too?

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Hi Julie. I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, ""North

has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and
still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it
was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.

According to Jacques, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, Kevin Kolb.  I just spoke to Kevin.  The Kuo's have been away on vacation.  He is going to try and get things finalized this week.  It sounds like they want to sign and exchange money in person.  This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probably be  the most convenient time.  I will let you know when I hear more from Kevin Kolb.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm thrilled to be working with you on this exciting project. I've reviewed the list of digital tools you sent over, and I think they have great potential for enhancing our language arts curriculum. I've also added a few more resources to the shared document that I believe could be valuable.

Regarding our budget for educational software, I've started researching some options and have a few initial recommendations. I think we should prioritize tools that are user-friendly, compatible with our existing systems, and offer strong support for reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. Let's discuss this further when we meet next week.

I'm confident that with our combined expertise and creativity, we'll create a cutting-edge curriculum that will engage and inspire our students. I'll be in touch soon to schedule our brainstorming session.

Writing a paper on our work is an excellent idea! It would be a great way to share our findings with a wider audience and potentially inspire others to take similar action in their communities. We can discuss this further once the project is launched and we've recovered from the conference.

I think we're just about ready to launch the project. I'll send out a final reminder to our contacts at the schools and community centers to ensure they're prepared to distribute the materials and promote the workshops.

Thanks for your hard work and dedication to this project. It's been a pleasure working with you!

Andy:
This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, 
unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between 
numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an 
unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the 
decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until 
the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going 
forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

Subject: RE: Interesting article on infrastructure and colonialism

Maria,

Thanks for sharing this article. It's a fascinating perspective that I haven't fully considered in my work. While I believe that infrastructure development is essential for improving quality of life, I can see how it can also perpetuate dependence if not done with the needs and desires of the community in mind.

In my current project, we've been working closely with local leaders and residents to ensure that the new roads and bridges we're building serve the community's needs and are maintained sustainably. It's a challenge, but I believe it's the right approach.

I'm curious to learn more about the history of infrastructure development in Puerto Rico and how it has influenced the current state of affairs. Maybe we can grab coffee sometime and discuss further?

Dear David,

I'm thrilled to hear that you'll be joining us as the keynote speaker! Your presence will undoubtedly make the symposium a success. I completely agree with you about the importance of discussing our personal connections to this work. It's often those experiences that drive our passion and dedication to finding solutions.

On a more personal note, I've been grappling with my own concerns about the future of space exploration, particularly when it comes to my child's interest in pursuing a career in the industry. I worry about the challenges they may face and the impact their work could have on the environment. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on balancing our professional and personal lives when it comes to this issue.

I'll keep you updated on the symposium's progress and will be in touch with more details as the event approaches. Thank you again for your support and participation.

Hi Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm so glad our work together has inspired you to consider a career in environmental science. It's a field with so many opportunities to make a real difference, and I think your programming skills could be a valuable asset.

I'd be more than happy to chat with you about making the transition. My journey into environmental science was a bit unconventional, but I've found that diverse backgrounds and skill sets are often an advantage in this field. I can share some resources and introduce you to some colleagues who might be able to provide more specific guidance based on your interests.

What does your schedule look like next week? I'm free Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning if you'd like to meet for coffee and discuss this further.

Looking forward to talking with you more about this exciting next step in your career!

Best,

John,

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for the update. I'm equally excited about the potential of this new site. From the data you've shared, it looks like we might be able to shed some light on the evolutionary timeline of this dinosaur species. I'm particularly interested in the sedimentary structures and how they can help us understand the depositional environment.

I'm available for a video call this Friday at 2 PM if that works for you. In the meantime, I'll reach out to the paleo lab and see if they can allocate some resources to help us with the extraction and analysis.

Great work so far, Emily. This could be a game-changer for our research!

    I hope this mail finds you well. I am Dhruv Gupta from B.Tech. third year in Computer Science department.

     This is to ask for an extension for assignment 3 of database course that is scheduled on 1st April. We have mid sem holidays till 31st March. Many of our group mates have planned their trips and wont be able to commit to the assignment. We will not have our devices and proper network to work with. The assignment is also tough and would require great efforts so it would be challenging for us to communicate with the group mates.

Moreover we have another submission on 1st April. So it is very hard for us to be able to do the assignment. I am writting this mail on behalf of many groups who are facing the same issue. Kindly do the needful and extend the deadline for atleast 3 days.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

Jim, 

Following up on the message I left you, I thought I'd send you some of the basic information on the Crossroads project to see if you have any interest in that area:

The facility will be a high flexibility, bedded salt cavern
Initial startup is expected in summer 2002 with 2 bcf working gas, eventual rampup to 3 bcf 
75 MMCF/D injection (at 2 bcf working)
200 MMCF/D withdrawal (at 2 bcf working)
Located near Brush, Colorado, in Morgan County.
Located at far east end of PSCo system, 7 miles from CIG and 10 miles from Kinder Morgan

This is all the information I have at the moment, in addition to some maps which you are welcomed to look at.  Garry Wilson and I will be meeting with the developer in Denver on Monday, but he'd like to see if we have interest sooner than that.  I apologize for the last-minute nature of the request, but we were just hoping for an initial gauge of your interest.  

Do you have any use for this capacity?  If so, at what price?  What would your timing requirements be?  Would you have any other conditions that would increase interest in this capacity?

Thanks for your attention.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions, I'll try following up with you tomorrow if you ahve any free time.  Thanks!

I'm glad you found my presentation interesting. I completely agree that incorporating hands-on experiments and real-world applications is crucial for engaging students in chemistry. I have some ideas that I think would work well with your approach to creating learning materials.

I'm available for a call next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon, if that works for you. Please let me know what time suits you best.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Hi Rebecca,

Thank you for opening up to me. I'm so glad you feel you can confide in me. I hear you 100% on the self-doubt and pushback from parents. It's something I've definitely struggled with too, especially being a young, new teacher. There have been times I've questioned whether I'm really making a difference.

But you know what? The connections we make with students, the lightbulb moments, the skills they develop - that's what really matters. Not whether we're following some arbitrary traditional model. You are an incredible teacher. Your passion and creativity are gifts to your students. Don't ever forget that.

I have so much more I want to say, but I think it'd be better discussed in person. What do you say we make a plan to get together soon? I'd love for you to come visit me at my parents' house in Springfield. It's a really charming small town and there's lots of good hiking nearby. My family would love to meet you, and I think it'd be a nice chance for us to relax and talk more. You can even stay over if you want. 

Let me know what you think! And definitely keep me posted on your Spain plans, that sounds amazing. 

You've got this, Rebecca. Don't give up on yourself. The world needs teachers like you.

Ethan,

That's amazing news about the transit of Venus! Your observation sounds incredible, and I'm sure our members and the public would love to hear about it at the anniversary event. Great idea!

I reached out to Dr. Novak, and she's excited to give a talk at our event. She's planning to discuss her latest research on potentially habitable exoplanets, which should be really engaging for everyone.

I'll send out a newsletter to the club members next week with updates on the event schedule and Dr. Novak's talk. Let's set up a time to meet and finalize the details for the stargazing party, too.

Looking forward to catching up and celebrating our club's 10th anniversary!

  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Subject: RE: Heliocentric Theory and the Catholic Church

Dear Robert,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some exciting news with you regarding our research project. I recently stumbled upon a rare, unpublished manuscript while conducting research at the Vatican Secret Archives. The manuscript appears to be a letter written by a lesser-known astronomer during the Renaissance, discussing the implications of the heliocentric theory and its potential conflict with the Church's teachings.

I believe this manuscript could provide valuable insights into the relationship between science and religion during this period, and I'm eager to incorporate it into our research. I've attached a scanned copy of the manuscript for your review. Please let me know your thoughts on its potential significance and how we might use it in our project.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Jeff,

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

Requisite hosts content for some customers in Denver, but the majority of its 
revenues are from licenses and contracts with SAP.  Based on negative net

Margaret -- It's critical that you get John Arnold's permission before using 
the attached spreadsheet and graphs.  They contain curves through July 12th.  
Also, you may want to get legal permission from Mark Taylor.

Hi Kal,
 Here are some screen shots, let me know if they will work for you.  I think 
we may need to double check with John Arnold- the trader- before using them 
for sure.  But I was told they would be okay.

Emily,

I've made a reservation for Friday, April 15th at 12:30 PM at the restaurant. I'll send you the details separately.

Your suggestion to review the latest draft and compile a list of remaining points is excellent. I'll do the same and come prepared with my thoughts and questions. I'm particularly interested in discussing the implications of our findings for local policy decisions and how we can effectively convey that in our paper.

I'm confident that our meeting will be productive and enjoyable. Safe travels to Chicago, and I look forward to seeing you soon!

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Phillip

Hi David,

It was great meeting you at the American Historical Association conference last month. I really enjoyed our conversation about the political developments in the early 19th century and the impact of the War of 1812 on American politics. Your presentation on Andrew Jackson's presidency was fascinating, and it got me thinking about the continuities and changes in American political culture during this period.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in staying in touch and perhaps collaborating on a project that explores these themes further. I'm currently working on an article about the Federalist Party's strategies during the War of 1812, and I think your insights on the Jacksonian era could help me situate my research within the broader historical context.

Let me know if you're up for a chat or a virtual coffee sometime soon.

Julie,

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

Hallo Hans,

Thank you for your email! I'm thrilled that you're as enthusiastic about this project as I am. I've been giving it a lot of thought and have some ideas for the guide that I'd like to share with you.

I agree that meeting up next week would be great. Wednesday afternoon works perfectly for me. Perhaps we could meet at the café near the hobby club? We could discuss our ideas over a cup of coffee.

I look forward to our collaboration and creating something truly unique for the model railroading community.

Hi Casey,

Thanks for reaching out. I had a chance to review the feedback from the grant committee, and I think we can definitely make some improvements to the website to make it more engaging and interactive.

One idea I had was to incorporate more multimedia elements, such as videos and audio descriptions of the different urban forests we're featuring. We could also add interactive maps that allow users to explore the different green spaces in the city and learn more about their ecological importance.

I'd be happy to set up a meeting with you to discuss these ideas further and come up with a plan for revamping the website. Let me know what works best for your schedule.

Looking forward to working together on this project!

Hi Emily,

It's so great to hear from you! Thank you for sending the article, I just finished reading it and found it incredibly insightful. The history of genetics is truly fascinating, and it's amazing to see how far we've come.

I would love to meet up with you while you're in town! It would be fantastic to catch up and discuss the article in more detail. I've actually been working on a research project related to the history of genetics, focusing on the contributions of lesser-known female geneticists. I'm really excited about the findings and would love to share them with you.

I'll be available any day after 2 pm during the conference week. Let me know what works best for you.

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out! It's great to hear from you. I'm glad you found our conversation at the conference interesting and valuable.

Regarding your question about incorporating conversational practice into a unit about grocery shopping, I have a few ideas. One activity I've found effective is a role-play where students work in pairs to practice asking and answering questions about grocery items, prices, and quantities. Another idea is to have students create a dialogue or short skit about a shopping scenario, which they can then perform for the class.

I'd be happy to share more ideas and collaborate on developing some lesson plans together. Let me know if you're interested!

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

Here is the story with Bobinchuck's bonds.  They are being placed privately with a fund of investors.  The interest is 7.7% with no credit enhancement.  I guess Agape is the 501-c-3 nonprofit.  That's why he has flexibility with the timing.

A collaborative mural and sculpture garden sound like fantastic ideas! The students will love the opportunity to create something together and display their work for everyone to see.

How about we also include a field trip to a local contemporary art gallery or museum? This will give the kids a chance to see modern art up close and be inspired by the works of living artists.

I'm free for a video call next Wednesday at 4 pm, if that works for you. We can iron out the details and start planning the camp schedule.

Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Hallo Elisabeth,

It's great to hear from you, and I'm thrilled that you'll be visiting Berlin for the conference! The city has so much to offer, and I'm happy to share some recommendations with you.

As for must-see attractions, you should definitely visit the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag Building, and the East Side Gallery. These landmarks are not only historically significant but also visually stunning. For a unique perspective on the city, I recommend taking a river cruise along the Spree.

When it comes to dining, Berlin has an incredible food scene. Some of my personal favorites are:

1. Horváth: A Michelin-starred restaurant serving modern Austrian cuisine.
2. Nobelhart & Schmutzig: Known for its focus on local, seasonal ingredients.
3. Mustafa's Gemüse Kebap: A popular street food stand in the Kreuzberg neighborhood, famous for its delicious kebabs.

As for networking events during the conference, there will be a welcome reception on the first evening, which is a great opportunity to meet fellow attendees. Additionally, many attendees gather at the nearby biergarten after the conference sessions. I'll be there too, so let's catch up in person!

I hope this information helps you plan your trip. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out. I look forward to seeing you in Berlin!

Hi Michael,

Thank you so much for the suggestions! The World Bank dataset and MapBox tool sound perfect for what I'm trying to accomplish. I really appreciate you sharing those resources.

I love the idea of co-teaching a lesson on demographic analysis and population trends. It would be great for the students to have access to your expertise. In fact, I was thinking we could take this collaboration a step further.

What if we designed a joint assignment where students from both our classes work together on a research project examining the impact of population growth on climate change in a specific city or region? They could use the datasets and tools we introduce in the lesson to conduct their analysis.

If you're on board, I'd be happy to work with you to design the assignment and assess the students' work.

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on creating an inclusive environment

Hi Jenna,

It sounds like you're off to a great start in your new role! Your plans for building relationships and providing professional development are exactly the right approach. 

In terms of specific strategies, one thing I've found effective is to use a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. UDL is all about designing instruction and environments that are accessible and engaging for all learners from the start, rather than trying to retrofit accommodations after the fact. There are some great resources available from CAST, the organization that developed the UDL framework, that could be really helpful for your trainings.

Another strategy that's worked well for me is to establish a clear protocol for identifying and addressing barriers to access and inclusion. This could involve regular audits of classrooms and school facilities, as well as soliciting feedback from students, parents, and teachers about any challenges they're experiencing. The key is to have a systematic way of identifying issues and then collaboratively developing solutions.

In terms of challenges, one of the biggest hurdles I've faced is resistance to change from some stakeholders who are comfortable with the status quo. In those situations, I've found it helpful to focus on building relationships and finding common ground, while also being clear and direct about the needs of our students and the legal requirements we must meet.

I'm happy to share more about my experiences and strategies in future emails. I'm also excited to hear about the progress you make in your new role and to support you however I can!

Hey Sam,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out about an idea I've been thinking about for our soccer program. I've been doing some research on the latest coaching techniques and best practices, and I think there's an opportunity for us to expand and improve our program.

I was hoping we could set up a meeting to discuss this further. I'd love to get your input and expertise on how we could integrate these ideas into our overall PE curriculum. Let me know when you're available to chat.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee

Hi Ryan,

I hope you're doing well and not working too hard! I wanted to reach out because I'm on the planning committee for this year's Heritage Days festival, and I think it would be great if you could give a talk. Specifically, we're looking for someone to speak about the recent shale oil boom and its impact from a geologist's perspective.

I know your schedule is crazy busy, but I really think our audience would find your insights fascinating. Even a short 20-30 minute talk would be great. Please let me know if you'd be willing and able to participate. The festival is the second weekend of October.

Looking forward to hearing back from you and hopefully seeing you there!

Phillip,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.  I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward 
play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying 
would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the 
strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.  
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be 
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full 
liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation 
demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d 
greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out 
of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing 
demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in 
industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think 
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward 
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage 
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month 
ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas 
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y 
on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C 
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power 
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. 
i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and

Subject: RE: Great meeting you at the conference

Emily,

Thank you for sharing your syllabus. I'm impressed by the depth and breadth of the material you cover in your course. It's fascinating to see how the interpretation of foundational documents has evolved over time in response to social justice issues in the United States.

Your course reminded me of a book I recently read titled ""The Evolution of Civil Rights: Exploring the Intersection of Law and Social Change"" by Dr. Lila Gupta. I think you might find it relevant to your work, as it examines the interplay between legal frameworks and social movements in advancing civil rights.

I'm also intrigued by the idea of comparing our respective approaches to teaching about historical conflicts. In my courses, I often emphasize the role of colonial legacies and modern geopolitics in shaping the Kashmir conflict. I wonder if there are parallels to be drawn with the role of historical documents and social movements in the American context.

I would be interested in exploring potential collaboration opportunities, perhaps in the form of a comparative analysis or a co-taught course.

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.
A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20

I have a few minor suggestions for revisions, which I've noted in the attached document. Overall, though, I think this post will be a great addition to my blog and will resonate with our readers.

Once you've had a chance to review and incorporate my feedback, please send the revised draft back to me. I'll then give it a final review and let you know when it's scheduled to be published.

Thank you again for your hard work on this post. I'm confident that our readers will find your journey and insights valuable and inspiring.

Subject: Alaska Purchase Exhibit - Educational Component

Maria,

I hope you're doing well. As you know, I'm currently working on a new exhibit about the Alaska Purchase and its impact on Russo-American relations. I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on an interactive educational component for children visiting the exhibit.

I think your expertise in creating engaging science content for kids could be invaluable in making this historical event more accessible and exciting for younger audiences. Perhaps we could create a game or a hands-on activity that demonstrates the geographical and cultural significance of the Alaska Purchase.

Let me know if you have any ideas or if you'd like to discuss this further. I'd be happy to meet and brainstorm together.

Best regards,
Alexei",research,No

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late 
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on 
v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on 
value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between 
hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 
cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is 
worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The 
same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally 
strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will 
lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because 
every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 
will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j 
blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h 
again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will 
be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it 
either way though.

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med

gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between 
say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts
cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this 
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about 
winter-as
we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win

Subject: RE: Neolithic Burial Site in the Orkneys

Finn,

I'm thrilled that we'll be able to connect on Tuesday afternoon. I've sent you a calendar invite for the call, and I'll include the relevant files and data in advance so you can review them beforehand.

Your idea to consult with a paleoclimatologist is brilliant. Understanding the environmental context of the site will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the lives of the Neolithic people and how they adapted to the challenges posed by the volcanic eruption and changing climate.

I've been giving some thought to the potential impact of the eruption on the surrounding landscape, and I believe it could have had a significant effect on the placement and design of the burial site. The presence of volcanic ash and other deposits in the area may have influenced the choice of burial locations and the materials used in the construction of the tombs.

I'm also curious to explore any potential ritual or symbolic significance the Neolithic people may have attributed to the volcanic event. It's possible that the eruption and its aftermath played a role in their spiritual beliefs and burial practices.

I'll be sure to include these thoughts in our discussion on Tuesday, and I look forward to hearing your perspective on these ideas.

Thank you again for your collaboration and enthusiasm, Finn. I have no doubt that our combined expertise will lead to a groundbreaking understanding of this remarkable site and the people who lived through such a transformative event.

Best regards,

Dear Dr. Davis,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Alex Johnson, and I am a student in your Mathematical Problem-Solving in Computer Science course. I am currently working on a project related to cache memory optimization in computer architecture, and I was hoping to seek your advice on how to approach the problem using mathematical modeling techniques.

I have been struggling to find an effective way to model the behavior of cache memories and optimize their performance. I believe that your expertise in mathematical modeling and problem-solving could provide valuable insights into this challenge.

Would it be possible to schedule a meeting with you to discuss my project in more detail? I would greatly appreciate any guidance you could offer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.

Subject: RE: Thoughts on the latest COVID-19 economic data?

Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you! I'm glad the class went well and that the students found it valuable. I'd definitely be interested in discussing the latest economic data with you further.

In terms of the new variants, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the increased transmissibility is concerning from a public health perspective. But from an economic standpoint, the fact that they seem to be leading to fewer hospitalizations and deaths is a positive sign.

I'm also very interested in moving forward with that research paper idea. I think there's a lot of potential there to explore the cost-effectiveness of different containment strategies. Let me know when you're available to brainstorm next steps.

Looking forward to catching up more soon!

Best,

Significant progress was recently made between Enron's and Salomon Smith
Barney's counsels.  We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be
used for both original and variation margin.  With these elevated NYMEX
margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some
of the small issues where we both share some exposure.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead
investment banks.  The relationship is so sound, we will work out the
wrinkles.  I'll be in touch.

P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Dear Ethan,

Thank you so much for your enthusiastic response! I am thrilled to have your expertise on board for this project. Your experience with Python libraries and machine learning will be invaluable in helping us uncover the full potential of the data we have collected.

I have attached a sample of the satellite data we have gathered, which includes information on the migration routes of humpback, gray, and blue whales over the past five years. Our primary research questions include:

1. Identifying key migration routes and timing for each species
2. Investigating potential environmental factors influencing migration patterns (e.g., sea surface temperature, prey availability)
3. Assessing potential threats to whale populations along their migration routes (e.g., shipping lanes, coastal development)

I would be happy to have a call next week to discuss these questions in more detail and begin planning our analysis. I am available Tuesday after 2 PM or Wednesday any time. Please let me know what works best for you.

Once again, I am excited to collaborate with you on this project and look forward to combining our skills to make a meaningful impact on whale conservation.

Hi Emily,

The week after next works great for me! I think your lecture will be a fantastic supplement to the lessons we've been doing on migration and urbanization. Please do send over the outline whenever you have a chance.

I took a look at the lesson plan you sent and I think it looks really strong! You've done a great job incorporating the resources and making the connections between climate change and human impacts clear. One suggestion I had was to maybe include a section on potential solutions or actions individuals can take to mitigate the effects of climate change. I think that could empower your students and give them a sense of agency.

I'm looking forward to our continued collaboration and to your guest lecture!

Dear Dr. Russo,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to thank you again for the valuable insights you shared during our panel discussion at the Special Education Conference last month. Your expertise in individualized learning strategies for kinesthetic learners was truly inspiring.

I've been implementing some of the techniques we discussed, such as incorporating more hands-on activities and group projects into my lessons. I've noticed a significant improvement in my students' engagement and comprehension. I would love to hear about any new strategies you've been exploring recently.

Additionally, I've been giving some thought to pursuing a career in educational psychology. I believe it would allow me to have a greater impact on the lives of students with diverse learning needs. I would greatly appreciate any advice or guidance you could offer.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Hello Curtis,

sorry for the late response.
An upgrade from E1 to E3 is not an option for the mentioned locations, for
the foreseeable future.
The 2. proposal is also not an option for us, because we buy bandwidth on
demand and the demands change very dynamically, therefore such a plan would
not fit our requirements.

best regards Dietmar

Dietmar,
   Attached is a message from Enron Broadband Services on sizing the
proposal back to SAP.
Hopefully his attached message is clear in terms of finding a way to
structure it
for growth based on your needs.  This would increase the size of our
arrangement if it
makes good sense for you.  Please get back to me with your thoughts.

Curtis - following our phone call this morning I met with Matt Harris and
our
structuring person (Glenn Surowiec) to review the deal. After some quick
analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.

The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.
The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.

Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).

For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

Please let me know what your thoughts are and let's talk ASAP.

Subject: RE: Interview Request for Article on New Melanoma Treatment

Dear Samantha,

Thank you for reaching out, and it's great to hear from you again. I remember our brief interaction at the conference last year and appreciate your interest in our work.

I would be happy to provide an interview for your article on the new melanoma treatment. As one of the lead researchers on the clinical trial, I can share insights into the treatment's mechanism of action, its potential benefits, and the next steps for further research and development.

I'm available for a phone interview next week, either on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Please let me know which time works best for you, and feel free to send me any specific questions you have in advance.

I also noticed that you mentioned a passion for hiking and camping in your email signature. My wife and I are planning a hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains next month. Do you have any favorite spots or trails you'd recommend?

I look forward to our interview and to sharing more about our exciting research.

Dear Robert,

Thank you for your feedback on my draft and for sharing your outline for our discussion. I have reviewed your comments and found them to be extremely helpful. I think your suggestions will strengthen the paper and help us to better integrate our research.

I have also looked over your outline and agree that the points you have listed are crucial for our collaboration. I have added a few additional topics that I think we should cover during our meeting:

1. The role of Galileo's trial in shaping the public perception of the heliocentric theory
2. The impact of the Protestant Reformation on the reception of the heliocentric theory in different European regions
3. Potential implications of our research for contemporary debates about science and religion

I look forward to discussing these topics and more during our video conference on Wednesday.

d quarter net income of $298 million, down 60 percent from $737 million in =
the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=
ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=
n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=
quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=
ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=
 of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =
September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=
ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=
ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=
nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =
of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=
-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=
 September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=
y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=
 of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=
e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =
expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =
operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=
ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=
 will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=
ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=
sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=
ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=
n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=
ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=
ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=
ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=
tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=
f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=
ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=
ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=
 on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=
r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =
  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=
time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =
19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=
nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=
ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=
rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =
we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=
estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=
airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =
the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=
 our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=
itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=
es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=
nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=
hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=
 the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=
e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=
 year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=

d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=
e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=
tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =
would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=
ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=
ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =
28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=
ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=
e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=
r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=
et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=
arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=
lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=
uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=
.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =
higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=
ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=
in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=
 expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=
ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=
ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=
on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=
ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=
lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=
rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=
 $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=
illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=
se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=
 therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=
an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =

 Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=
62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=
d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=
s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=
ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=
sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =
the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =
lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=
agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=
ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=
 primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=
control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=
 company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=
ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=
ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=
lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=
rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=
ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=
 ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=
ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=
ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=
ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=
, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=
sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=

as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=

Subject: RE: Continuing our discussion on Kashmir

Aisha,

I completely agree with your suggestion for structuring the paper. Having each of us take the lead on sections that align with our expertise and perspectives, while ensuring an overall balanced approach, will make for a stronger and more compelling piece.

As for specific aspects to focus on, I think it's crucial that we examine the historical context of the conflict, particularly the events leading up to the current flare-up in violence. We should also analyze the geopolitical implications, both in terms of India-Pakistan relations and the broader regional dynamics (e.g., China's role, the impact on Afghanistan, etc.).

Additionally, I believe we should address the human rights issues at play, particularly the plight of the Kashmiri people caught in the middle of this long-standing dispute. This is an area where I think your insights and expertise would be particularly valuable.

Let's touch base next week to finalize our outline and divide up the research and writing tasks. I'm happy to take the lead on the historical and geopolitical sections, while you focus on the human rights aspects and the Kashmiri perspective.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration!

Best regards,
Rajesh",research,No

Jeff,

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

Heidi:

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Thanks,

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

Emily,

Thank you for sharing this incredible find! I've reviewed the letter, and I agree that it provides valuable insights into the economic motivations behind the Southern perspective. It's a fascinating piece of history that could really enhance our presentation.

I think we should definitely incorporate this new information. It might require some last-minute adjustments, but I believe it will be worth it. We'll need to carefully consider how this letter fits into our overall narrative and how it supports our thesis.

I suggest we set up a video call to discuss our strategy for integrating this new document. Are you available tomorrow afternoon, say around 2 PM EST? If not, let me know what works best for you.

I'm looking forward to diving deeper into this new material and refining our presentation.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate.  I believe Jim

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I'm working on a proposal for a new solar telescope that could revolutionize our understanding of the sun's atmosphere. I remember you mentioned at the conference a few years ago that you were interested in how stellar evolution impacts galaxy formation, and I think this technology could be a game-changer for your research as well.

The proposed telescope would use advanced adaptive optics to achieve unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the UV and X-ray wavelengths, allowing us to study the sun's magnetic field and coronal mass ejections in much greater detail than ever before. I'm thinking this could also be applied to studying the formation and evolution of massive stars in distant galaxies, which could shed light on the role of dark matter in galaxy formation.

I'd love to get your thoughts on this and see if you'd be interested in collaborating on the proposal. Let me know if you have any questions or ideas!

Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.
Mery

Hi Liam,

Tuesday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let's meet in the faculty lounge – it's a nice, relaxed setting for brainstorming.

I've been thinking about how we can incorporate cost-benefit analysis and production theory into the course while also addressing social and emotional development. I believe that by providing students with a strong foundation in economic principles, we can then explore how these concepts play out in real-world scenarios, particularly in terms of social dynamics and equity.

I'd love to hear your initial thoughts on this approach and any ideas you have for specific topics or activities we could include in the course.

Greg,

I have been working with Bill Montez.  I furnished a personal financial statement, EIN number, and we worked through a variety of forms.  I am pulling together the partnership agreement and other organizational documents.  Let me know what else I need to do.

I received the final geotech report yesterday.  Let me know what this means.  It did not look good to me.  Crazy amounts of fill and still nowhere near a PVR of 1"".  

Bobincheck got me all fired up about HUD being out of money yesterday.  Darrell calmed me down somewhat, but should we go ahead and submit a package to Bank One just in case?

Still need to look at the numbers once again.  Email when ready.

Dear Mr. Green,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Emily Johnson, a mathematics teacher at Ridgemont Middle School, and I believe we are neighbors. I'm reaching out to you because my students are working on a project that involves using coding to optimize garden layouts and planting schedules. Given your expertise in gardening, particularly in USDA Hardiness Zone 8, I was wondering if you might be willing to share some insights with us.

The students are participating in a school-wide science fair, and their project aims to create a sustainable garden using computational thinking. Your advice on gardening techniques specific to our climate zone would be invaluable in helping them create more accurate and effective garden plans.

If you have any time in the coming weeks, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this project with you further. Please let me know if you would be interested in mentoring my students or providing any guidance on this project.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.

The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.

Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay ""0"" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?


Regards,

Yevgeny

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

Subject: Grant Proposal Collaboration

Hi Robert,

I hope you're doing well. As you know, our department chair has asked us to collaborate on a grant proposal for a research project on the application of econometric models in economic forecasting. I think this is a great opportunity for us to combine our expertise and work on a project that could have a significant impact on our field.

I was thinking about potential research questions, and I believe we should focus on the following: ""How can econometric models be used to improve short-term and long-term economic forecasting accuracy?"" What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any suggestions for refining the question or other aspects of the proposal?

Please let me know your availability for a meeting to discuss this further. I'm excited to work with you on this project!

Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the science education conference last week! I really enjoyed your presentation on engaging ways to explain weather phenomena. As I mentioned, I'm a high school chemistry teacher focused on molecular orbital theory and atomic structure. I think our areas of expertise could complement each other well for a collaborative project.

I had an idea: what if we create a series of blog posts and videos that explore the connections between chemistry and weather? For example, we could look at how atomic structure relates to the formation of clouds or how molecular orbital theory can help explain the formation of ozone. We could share these materials on our social media channels and websites to reach a wider audience.

What do you think? If you're interested, we can discuss the logistics of the project, such as timelines, content creation, and promotion strategies.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on a study examining the effectiveness of different instructional methods in intro econ courses. I've been experimenting with some new approaches in my classes and have been curious to see if they make a significant difference in student learning outcomes. I know you've also been doing some innovative things in your classes at UNC.

If you're open to it, I'd love to discuss the possibility of designing a study together. We could potentially apply for grant funding to support the work.

Let me know if this piques your interest! I'd be happy to set up a call to brainstorm further.

Subject: Exciting New Teaching Method

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something exciting with you that I learned at the chemistry education conference last week. I attended a session on a new teaching method called ""Modeling Instruction"" that I think could be really beneficial for our students.

The basic idea behind Modeling Instruction is to engage students in building and testing mental models of chemical concepts through a series of guided inquiries and activities. The goal is to help students develop a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms of chemistry.

I've attached a few resources that provide an overview of the method and some example activities. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it and discuss whether we might be able to incorporate some of these ideas into our curriculum.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to chat more about this!

Best,
Emily",research,No

Alexei,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled to hear about your new exhibit and would love to collaborate on an educational component for children. I agree that creating a game or hands-on activity could be a great way to engage young visitors and help them understand the significance of the Alaska Purchase.

I've been working on a new science curriculum for local elementary schools and have been looking for ways to incorporate local history and our museum's exhibits into the program. This could be a perfect opportunity to combine our efforts and create something truly unique and educational.

I'm free to meet next week to discuss ideas and plan our next steps. Please let me know your availability.

I'm free on the second and third evenings of the conference. If you're okay with it, I was thinking we could try out a local restaurant and explore the city a bit. I've never been to San Francisco before, so I'm excited to see what it has to offer!

Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Phillip

Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Subject: RE: Following up on our conversation at the Galapagos Conference

Dear Dr. Silva,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in a potential collaboration. I, too, found our conversation at the conference to be thought-provoking and believe that our respective fields of research could complement each other well.

Your work on the political factors influencing environmental policy in Brazil is particularly relevant to my research on the Galapagos Islands, where government policy plays a crucial role in managing invasive species and protecting the unique ecosystems. I would be very interested in exploring how the transition from authoritarianism to democracy in Brazil has impacted environmental policy and conservation efforts, and how this might compare to other island contexts.

I will send you some of my recent publications on invasive species management in the Galapagos, and I would be keen to read your work on Brazilian environmental policy. Perhaps we could arrange a video call in the coming weeks to discuss our research in more detail and brainstorm potential collaborative projects?

Please let me know your availability, and I will be happy to coordinate a time that works for both of us.

John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

Subject: New software tool for Gulf Stream project

Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some exciting news with you regarding our Gulf Stream project. Over the past few weeks, I've been working on a new software tool that I believe could significantly improve the efficiency of our model.

The tool utilizes a novel algorithm to optimize the computational process, potentially reducing the time required for simulations by up to 50%. I've conducted some initial tests, and the results look promising.

Before presenting this tool to the rest of the team, I wanted to get your feedback. Would you be available for a quick call this week to discuss the tool and its potential implications for our research? I'd be happy to provide a demo and answer any questions you may have.

Let me know your availability, and I'll set up a meeting.

I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better 
replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change them",student,No

Subject: RE: Final touches on the grant proposal

Emily,

Thank you for your email and suggestions. I agree with all of your points and think they will greatly strengthen our proposal.

I particularly like your idea of emphasizing the potential impact of our research in the introduction. Highlighting the recent droughts and the urgency of the issue will certainly grab the reviewers' attention.

I also think providing more details on the polymers and their synthesis is crucial. We want to make sure the reviewers understand the technical aspects of our project and how it differs from previous approaches.

As for the scalability discussion, I believe it's essential to show that our research has the potential to make a significant impact beyond the local level. I can draft a brief section on this and send it to you for your input.

Please go ahead and make the changes you suggested. I'll review the updated draft on Friday and provide any feedback I may have. We should definitely have enough time to make any final adjustments before the deadline.

I echo your sentiment – it's been a pleasure collaborating with you on this project. Your expertise in biochemistry has been invaluable, and I believe our interdisciplinary approach will make our proposal stand out.

Hi Emily,

I just had a chance to read through your TED Talk script and I think it's fantastic! You've done a great job weaving in relatable examples and storytelling to make the science accessible. I especially loved the analogy about the radiation therapy being like a precisely targeted ""tiny army"" attacking the cancer cells. That's such a powerful way to help people understand the concept.

I think this talk is going to be a huge hit and I'm so excited for you! Your work is making such an impact and it's wonderful that you're sharing it with the world in such an engaging way.

I'll see you soon at the science fair! Let me know if you need anything else.

Subject: RE: Collaborating on a project to promote child health through storytelling

Liam,

Thank you for sending the calendar invite. I've accepted it and added the Zoom link to my schedule.

I completely agree with the themes you've suggested for the stories. Focusing on healthy eating habits, physical activity, emotional well-being, and hygiene and disease prevention is crucial, especially in the current context. We could also consider incorporating messages about the importance of sleep and limiting screen time, as these are often overlooked aspects of child health.

Your idea to create a framework or guidelines for adapting the stories to different cultural contexts is brilliant. We could consult with experts in cultural competence and early childhood education to ensure our approach is inclusive and effective.

I've been thinking about potential funding sources for our project. I have some contacts at the World Health Organization and UNICEF who might be interested in supporting our initiative. I'd be happy to reach out to them and explore the possibilities.

Looking forward to our call next week to discuss these ideas further!

Subject: RE: Collaborative project idea - History and Art

Dear Dr. Johnson,

Our meeting on Tuesday was incredibly productive, and I'm thrilled with the direction we've decided to take the project. The students will be researching and creating digital art pieces based on the following events:

1. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783)
2. The Whiskey Rebellion (1794)
3. The Louisiana Purchase (1803)
4. The Battle of New Orleans (1815)

I've created a shared folder with resources for each event, which I've shared with you. Please feel free to add any additional resources you think would be helpful for the students.

I'll introduce the project to the students next week and begin the research phase. We'll keep you updated on their progress, and we can schedule another meeting to discuss their initial ideas for the digital art pieces.

Thank you again for your collaboration and expertise. I know this project will be a success thanks to your involvement.

Best regards,
Sarah Thompson",research,No

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on creating an inclusive environment

Hi Jenna,

It's great to hear from you! Congratulations on your new position - that's exciting news. I'm happy to share some insights and strategies that have worked well for me in creating inclusive school environments.

One of the most important things, I've found, is to start by building relationships with key stakeholders - administrators, teachers, parents, and students. It's crucial to have open and honest conversations about the needs of students with disabilities and to collaborate on developing policies and practices that support their success.

Another key strategy is to provide ongoing professional development and training for educators, focusing on best practices for teaching and supporting students with disabilities. It's also important to ensure that accommodations and modifications are consistently implemented and that students have access to the tools and resources they need to thrive academically and socially.

I'd be happy to share more detailed recommendations and resources, and I'm also curious to learn more about your new role and the specific challenges you anticipate. It sounds like an exciting opportunity to make a real difference for your students!

Best,
Alex",research,No

I agree.  Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about 
this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward.  I'd 
definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall 
commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply 
in the very near future.  I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with 
HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless 
decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, 
and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably 
linked.  Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more 
recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg 
understand that his focus was different than ours.  

Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process.  I have 
certainly found her involvement invaluable.  

Patrick

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

John,

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.

Reagan,

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Hi Dr. Patel,

It was great to meet you at the conference last week and learn more about your fascinating research in nanotechnology and gene therapy. I was really impressed by your presentation and the potential impact your work could have on medicine.

As I mentioned, I'm always looking for ways to bring cutting-edge science into the classroom and make it accessible to students. I think there could be a great opportunity to collaborate on some educational materials that showcase the real-world applications of your research. I'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you and see if we can come up with a project that would be engaging for high school students.

Subject: New malware targeting financial institutions

Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some important information with you that I learned at the recent cybersecurity conference I attended. It appears that there's a new type of malware that has been targeting financial institutions, and I believe it could pose a significant threat to our clients.

The malware, dubbed ""FinStealer,"" is designed to infiltrate banking systems and steal sensitive customer data. It uses advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software, making it particularly dangerous.

I think we need to act quickly to develop a solution to protect our clients from this threat. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss this further and brainstorm some ideas?

Let me know your availability.

Hey Michael,

It's been great keeping in touch since we met at the conference in Philadelphia last year. I've been thinking a lot about our discussions on making complex topics more accessible to the general public. I believe our collaboration could lead to something truly unique, combining our expertise in oncology and colonial-era history.

I have an idea for a project that explores the history of skin cancer treatments and how they've evolved over time. I think it would be fascinating to compare modern treatments with the practices used during the colonial era. Your insights into the historical context would be invaluable.

Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. I'd love to brainstorm some ideas and see if we can develop a proposal.

Jennifer,
I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

JY
p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for 
all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are 
at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.

Dear Robert,

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in collaborating! I think this project has the potential to make a significant contribution to our field. I am available for a video conference next Wednesday at 10 AM EST, if that suits you. We can discuss our research findings and ideas for the paper in more detail.

In the meantime, I have attached a draft of the first section of my paper, focusing on the initial reactions to the heliocentric theory within the Catholic Church. Please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions.

Looking forward to our discussion next week.

Hey Liam,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because I recently made a fascinating discovery at one of our dig sites in Montana. We uncovered a new theropod fossil that exhibits some unique features, and I think it could have significant implications for our understanding of theropod evolution.

I was hoping to collaborate with you on a research paper analyzing the fossil and its potential impact. Your expertise in Cretaceous theropods would be invaluable. Are you interested in working together on this project?

Chaz & Steve,

I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with 
Jennifer Medcalf.  

During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during 
their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have 
attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has 
with regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn't 
been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net 
Works has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels that 
without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.

The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) ""...haven't 
kept up with the industry"", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.

You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification 
and liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed 
this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of ""advance purchase"" of BMC product.

For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to ""click"" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a ""future purchases"" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.

If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.

Thanks,

Jeff

Dear Dr. Nguyen,

Thank you so much for your prompt and informative response. I really appreciate you taking the time to share these valuable resources and insights with me.

The concept of using incentives and rewards to drive player behavior is particularly intriguing to me. I can see how carefully designing the economic systems within a game can create a more engaging and motivating experience for players.

I will definitely dive into the resources you recommended. ""The Art of Game Design"" and ""Rules of Play"" sound like essential reads for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of game design principles. I'm also excited to check out the Extra Credits YouTube channel and explore their series on video game economies.

As I progress with my game development projects, I will likely have more specific questions related to applying economic principles. It's reassuring to know that I can reach out to you for guidance.

Thank you once again for your generosity in sharing your knowledge. Your expertise is greatly appreciated, and I'm excited to continue learning from you.

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Hi Alex,

I love the idea of inviting a local politician to the workshop! It would definitely provide a valuable perspective on the importance of critical thinking and reasoning skills in real-world decision-making. I'm excited to see how the students will react to this addition.

Thank you for offering to handle the invitation and coordination with the politician. That would be a great help, and it allows me to focus on finalizing the math game and preparing other materials for the workshop.

I'm looking forward to our collaboration and making this workshop a success. Please keep me updated on the progress with the politician, and let's schedule a meeting soon to discuss the game and other workshop details.

Best,

Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention ""Gary 
King"" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several ""touchpoints"" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Larry,

I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project.  They need 
the following:

Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.
Builders resume listing similar projects

The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday.  If we are 
interested in his loan, he would want to  come see the site.
If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along.   You can 
send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).

The broker is Jim Murnan.  His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call 
him and send the documents to him directly.

It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership 
agreement.  I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon 
as possible.  

Please email or call with  an update.

Hi Emily,

Thank you for sharing this exciting news! I had not heard of the Solar Water Purifier before, but it sounds like a promising solution for our projects. I would definitely be interested in learning more about its technical specifications, cost, and implementation requirements.

I think this technology could have a significant impact on the communities we serve, especially in remote areas where access to clean water is limited. It would be great to discuss this further and explore the possibility of a pilot project in either Kenya or India.

Speaking of which, I have been invited to speak at the Global Health Conference in Geneva next month and would love to include some of our collaborative work in my presentation. I think our projects could serve as great case studies for innovative WASH solutions. Would you be open to discussing this further and providing some input on the content?

Thank you for your email! It was wonderful to meet you as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner conversation. It's always a pleasure to connect with someone who shares my passion for postal history.

The conference was indeed quite an experience. It was my first time attending the World Stamp Show, and I was blown away by the sheer scale of it all. The exhibits were incredible, and I came away with several new additions to my own collection.

I would be delighted to collaborate with you on a research project. In fact, I've been working on an article about the role of the postal system in the spread of information during the 19th century, and I think your expertise would be invaluable.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

Hi Margaret,

It was such a pleasure to meet you at the Religion, Culture, and the Environment conference last week. I really enjoyed your presentation on the environmental stewardship mandate in the Geneva Bible and its influence on American history. As someone who teaches and writes about environmental ethics from a more secular perspective, I found your talk really fascinating and thought-provoking.

I would love to continue our conversation about the intersections of religion, philosophy, and environmental responsibility. I'm curious to hear more about your perspective on the role of faith communities in addressing environmental issues today. Do you see this as an important priority for your church and denominational community?

I'd also be happy to share more about my work on eco-feminism and animal rights if you're interested. I think there could be some interesting parallels and points of connection with your own scholarship, even though we're coming from quite different angles.

Let me know if you'd like to continue the conversation via email or even set up a time to chat by phone or video. I'd be glad to hear your thoughts!

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

Hi David,

That's great that you've been finding some interesting things in Africa. I'm really excited to hear all about it when you get back. It sounds like we may have a lot to discuss and potentially some new directions to explore in our research.

In the meantime, I'll start digging into this new evidence about Homo erectus' diet and see if I can find any other articles or studies that support or refute it. If we can incorporate this into our research, it could really strengthen our arguments.

Safe travels and I'll talk to you soon!

Jeff,

Here is a recent rentroll.  I understand another looker went to the 
property.  I want to hear the feedback no matter how discouraging. I am in 
Portland for the rest of the week.  You can reach me on my cell phone 
713-410-4679.  My understanding was that you would be overnighting some

Call me if necessary.

Michael,

Next Wednesday at 2 PM EST works perfectly for me. I'll keep an eye out for the Zoom link.

That's a great idea to involve local stakeholders. I have some contacts at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources who might be interested in collaborating. I'll reach out to them to gauge their interest and see if they can provide any insights or resources for our project.

In terms of funding, I came across a few potential opportunities that I think we should explore:

1. The National Science Foundation's Environmental Biology Program
2. The EPA's STAR (Science to Achieve Results) Grants
3. The Chesapeake Bay Trust's Research and Innovation Grants

I'll gather more information on each of these and send it your way before our call.

I'm really excited about the potential of this project and the impact we could make together. See you next Wednesday!

Chad,

Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to 
use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should 
help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you 
are dying to do another rotation is risk.

Hi Rachel,

I was thinking we could hold the event on Saturday, May 15th, from 10 am to 2 pm. We could feature interactive reading stations, health screenings, and a special guest speaker. What do you think about this plan? Do you have any suggestions or ideas for activities?

Dear Dr. Davis,

Thank you so much for agreeing to the interview! I greatly appreciate your willingness to share your expertise with my readers.

September 15th works perfectly for me. I will be attending the conference from the beginning, so I can meet you at the venue during one of the breaks, as you suggested. Please let me know which break would be most convenient for you, and I will ensure to be there.

I am truly excited about our collaboration and the opportunity to learn more about your groundbreaking research. Your work is crucial in raising awareness about the impact of environmental factors on human health, and I am honored to have the chance to share it with my audience.

Thank you once again, and I look forward to meeting you in person at the conference.

Best regards,

Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

Regards,

Lucy, 

Here is a rentroll for this week.  

What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(this week)= 
300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate 
clearly.

#2 still owe deposit?

#9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.

Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you next week.

In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy 
the property.  I will keep you informed.

Dear Dr. Thompson,

Thank you so much for your detailed and insightful response. Your expertise has provided me with a much deeper understanding of the topic and will be invaluable in strengthening my essay.

I was particularly struck by your point about the importance of nutrition education and promoting healthy eating habits. In my research, I've found that many school nutrition programs have focused primarily on providing healthy meals, but less on educating students about making healthy choices. Do you think this is a significant gap in current approaches, and if so, what strategies do you believe would be most effective in addressing it?

I'd also be interested to hear more about your current research project on the effectiveness of school nutrition programs across Europe. What have been some of the key findings so far, and are there any particular success stories or best practices that stand out?

Thank you again for taking the time to share your knowledge and insights. I greatly appreciate your support and encouragement.

of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?

Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would 
appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.

Background:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year 
with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic 
Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong 
business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has 
had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this 
relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.

A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both 
companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to 
expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in 
weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to 
specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th 
meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, 
(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.

Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his 
availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for 
a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he 
is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 
Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific 
preference?

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, 
we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan 
Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather 
derivatives opportunities, respectively.  

Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's 
current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed 
initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry 
Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing 
input on this.

Bob,

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Dear Evelyn,

Thank you for reaching out about the Community Health & Science Fair exhibit. I'm delighted to have the opportunity to collaborate with you on this important project.

I think your idea of incorporating a paleontological perspective is fascinating and could provide a unique context for understanding the history of disease and immunity. As a pediatrician specializing in adolescent medicine, I'm particularly interested in highlighting the impact of vaccinations on young people's health and the ongoing challenges in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

I would be happy to meet for coffee next week to discuss our ideas further. How about we meet at the Willowbrook Café on Tuesday morning, say around 9 AM? Let me know if that works for you.

I look forward to working together to create an engaging and informative exhibit for the community.

Lucy,

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

Subject: RE: Urgent: Multiple clients targeted by sophisticated malware attack

Michael,

I agree with your approach. We need to be cautious and limit the information we share with the client until we can rule out any potential moles. I've already started working on a containment plan, and I'll share it with you during our call at 2 PM.

In the meantime, I'll continue analyzing the malware samples to see if I can find any clues about the attackers' identity or their motivations. I'll also reach out to our contacts in the cybersecurity community to see if they have any information that could help us with our investigation.

Let's reconvene after our call and develop a comprehensive plan to deal with this threat.

Best,
Samantha",research,No

Subject: Site Location Advisory Service




I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service
providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location
Advisory Service.

With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We
are finding that more and more US corporations are looking north as they are
faced with fewer satisfactory location alternatives in which to expand.
Canada, with its relatively large and well trained work force, not to
mention lower operating costs, is increasingly being considered by companies
such as yours.

Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is
a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor
force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive

Hi Dr. Jones,

Thank you so much for your helpful advice! I appreciate you taking the time to share your knowledge with me. ""Heartgard Plus"" sounds like a great option for heartworm prevention. I'll make sure to get a supply once I adopt my German Shepherd.

I love the idea of having educational materials and a booth at the pet adoption event. It would be wonderful if we could work together to help new pet owners understand the importance of heartworm prevention and overall pet health. Please let me know what I can do to assist you in setting this up.

Once again, thank you for your support. I'm looking forward to becoming a responsible dog owner and making a positive impact at the adoption event.

I'm particularly interested in your work on the impact of forest restoration on carbon sequestration and biodiversity. I believe that combining our expertise could lead to some significant contributions to the field.

Jeff,

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in 
August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave
Spurlin ""Owns"" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.
All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life
easier.

Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My
reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron
and Compaq.  We are both exposed to potential unnecessary pitfalls that are
clearly evident in the original agreement.

We look forward to resolving this issue, amending this agreement, and moving
forward in the partnership between Enron and Compaq.

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.
After
our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the
point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq
to
direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or
Kent
Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time
with
David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and
issues.

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop
the
streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting
that
there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server
Supply
Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and
Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product
and
Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has
had
internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our
relationship.

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework
for
our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those
changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq
was
invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,
2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section
3.0 on
or before December 31,2000.
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,
Compaq
(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The
understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice
and
payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new
contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS
strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq
believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look
forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Thank you for sending over the project details. I've reviewed the document, and I have a better understanding of the device's requirements and its role in your research.

I've started sketching out some initial designs and components that we might need. I'm thinking we can use a combination of FPGA and microcontroller units to handle the data processing and interface with the telescope's systems.

I've also been doing some research on the James Webb Space Telescope, and I'm blown away by its capabilities. It's incredible to think that our collaboration could contribute to unraveling the mysteries of the early universe.

weather.  when we get into injections, i think we'll see a big push down.  
spec and trade seem bearish but hesitant to get short.  customer buying still 
strong.  thus even with the demand picture becoming clearer, we haven't moved 
down.  however i think when the picture becomes clearer (i.e.-when we start 
beating last year's injections by 20 bcf a week), trade will get short.  
customers very unsophistocated.  the story they keep telling us is we're 
coming out 400 bcf less than last year, thus the summer has to be strong.  
when we start inj, customers will start seeing other side of story.  pira 
finally came out this week and said stop buying.  to me, the mrkt just a 
timing issue.  i want to be short before the rest of the idiots get short.  i 
continue buying m,f puts.  projecting k to settle 450 and m 400.

Hey Sam,

I wanted to let you know that I hit submit on our grant application last night! Fingers crossed we hear back soon. I'm so excited about the possibility of expanding our program to more schools.

In the meantime, I've been working on some ideas for our blog. I think it would be great to write a post about our experience co-teaching the Minecraft coding class last semester. I can draft something up and send it your way for feedback.

Let me know if you have any other blog post ideas! I'm hoping to get a couple more up before the school year starts.

Talk to you soon,

am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out

Emily,

Creating a narrative around the stamp and the Centennial Exposition is a fantastic idea. It'll definitely make the history more relatable and engaging for our audience. I'm excited to brainstorm with you on Saturday and finalize the structure of our presentation.

As for your idea of expanding our project to include workshops or seminars, I think it's a great initiative. Engaging the community and promoting a sense of pride and belonging through history is a powerful concept. We could potentially collaborate with local schools, libraries, and community centers to reach a wider audience.

I'll come prepared with some ideas on how we can structure these workshops and the key messages we want to convey. We can also discuss the logistics and potential partnerships during our meeting.

Looking forward to a productive discussion on Saturday!

Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

I love your ideas! Including student work and quotes is a great way to show the real impact coding can have. And I completely agree about creating a handout with resources - that will be so helpful for teachers who want to get started.

The Scratch project is a perfect example to showcase. It really demonstrates how coding can spark creativity and problem-solving skills. I'm also thinking about including the data analysis project my students did using Python. They were so excited to see how they could use coding to make sense of real-world data.

How about we divide and conquer? I can work on the intro and the student work examples, and you can put together the resources and tips handout. We can meet on Wednesday afternoon to put it all together and practice our presentation.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

Hiroshi,

It's wonderful to hear from you, and I'm so excited to learn about your new exhibit project. The pieces you've shared look absolutely stunning, and I can already tell this is going to be a truly exceptional showcase of Heian period Buddhist art.

I'd be more than happy to provide whatever insights and advice I can to help bring your curatorial vision to life. After looking through the images, a few key themes and ideas immediately jumped out at me that I think could be really powerful to explore in the exhibit:

1. The evolution of Buddhist iconography over the course of the Heian period, and how changes in artistic style and representation reflect the shifting religious and political landscape of the time.

2. The role of art and aesthetics in Heian period Buddhist practice, and how these artifacts would have functioned within ritual and devotional contexts.

3. The influence of Chinese and Korean Buddhist art on Heian period artists and artisans, and the ways in which they adapted and transformed these foreign styles to create something uniquely Japanese.

I'd be happy to expand on any of these ideas further, and to offer suggestions on how you might group and present the artifacts to bring out these themes most effectively. I'm also happy to look over any labels or interpretive text you're developing to provide feedback and edits.

It's been far too long since we last saw each other, and I would love to find an opportunity to meet up again soon. Perhaps I could plan a trip to Kyoto once the exhibit is installed? It would be wonderful to see it in person and to catch up properly.

I'm also curious to hear more about how things are going at your museum, and if there have been any exciting new acquisitions or projects since we last spoke.

Thank you again for reaching out, and for trusting me with your curatorial process. I'm honored to be able to play even a small role in bringing this important exhibit to life.

Subject: RE: Potential collaboration on Amazon infrastructure project

Hi Marco,

It's great to hear from you! I've also been thinking a lot about our discussion at the conference. A collaborative project on the socio-political and ecological impacts of that new Amazon infrastructure project sounds like a fascinating and important undertaking. 

I did some preliminary research on the project and it looks like it could have severe consequences for several sensitive wetland ecosystems and protected indigenous territories in the region. Analyzing the political drivers and decision-making behind it from your perspective could really shed light on how these kinds of large-scale projects get approved despite major environmental and social costs.

I'd definitely be interested in exploring a collaboration further. Do you want to set up a video call next week to discuss potential approaches and next steps? Let me know what works for your schedule.

Best,
Julia",research,No

I want to personally thank you for supporting the BRM deal and I look forward to working with each of you to make this deal a success. I have provided the email below for your information.  The current next steps are as follows:

Yevgeny & I will meet with Vince Kaminski (tomorrow) to get his support as an Exec SME and get his nominee for content SME;
Phillip will provide his nominee for content SME (by tomorrow);
I will contact both Phillip's & Vince's content SME nominee (By Wednesday); and
All SME's will meet and have a demo provided by Accenture. (as soon as possible and feasible based on schedules)

Thus the SME picture should look like  this

Exec SME's : Phillip, Vince, & John

Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.


List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

(See attached file: Deliverables Tracking 081301.xls)


Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
start as stated above.
(See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)

I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me
know how things are going.

Hi Samantha,

Thank you for the update! I'm equally impressed with our students' dedication and creativity. They've truly embraced the spirit of this project.

Regarding the storybook layout, I think it would be great to group the pages by culture or region. This way, readers can easily follow the different stories and appreciate the cultural connections. We could also include a world map at the beginning of the book, highlighting the various countries and regions represented.

I've spoken with Principal Johnson, and she suggested holding the event on the last Friday of this month, from 6-8 PM. This should give us enough time to finalize preparations and promote the event to our school community. What do you think?

I'm excited to see our students' hard work come to fruition! Let's touch base early next week to discuss any additional details and make sure we're on track.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad to know that our work in India continues to inspire and inform your efforts back home. The project you mentioned sounds fantastic – I'm not surprised that you're leading the charge on creating more inclusive learning environments for DHH students. Your dedication to your students is truly admirable.

Thank you for sharing that report. It's a timely and relevant resource, given my current work on a global sanitation campaign. We're focusing on promoting handwashing habits and improving access to clean water in schools, which aligns perfectly with the findings in the report. I'll definitely share it with my team and see how we can incorporate some of those insights into our strategy.

I'm currently based in Geneva, but I do have some travel planned in the coming months. I'll keep you posted on my schedule and would love to take you up on that offer to meet up if I find myself in Seattle. It would be great to reconnect in person and learn more about the work you're doing.

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Corporation

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

hedged and day traded to keep from losing a ton, let go og the delta after aga
number which was exactly on my forecast still implying 7.5 bcf swing(i 
actually
thot it could have been worse so my range pre was 5-12 basis past cupla weeks
aga. that said i with you took my lumps. having a very good month in petro
helped me hold on to natgas shit p&l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be
more patient.
    think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up
traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit.
    what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a
more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch
out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the
economy is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint
getting up.

Subject: RE: Progress on the AV sensor integration paper

Hi Priya,

Thanks for your thoughtful response. You raise some excellent points about the limitations of speed sensors in certain conditions, and I agree that we need to address these issues in the paper. I think a balanced approach that acknowledges both the strengths and weaknesses of each technology is the way to go.

I'm happy to meet next week to discuss this further. Tuesday afternoon works well for me – how about we meet at 2 PM in the AVTech conference room? That should give us plenty of time to dig into the details and find a way forward.

In the meantime, I'll send you the latest draft of the paper so you can review it before our meeting. Please feel free to make any edits or suggestions directly in the document.

Looking forward to our discussion and to continuing to work together on this important project.

Best,

Subject: RE: Need help with paleontology data analysis

Hi David,

Thank you so much for your willingness to help with this project! I'm excited to collaborate with you and combine our expertise in biology and computer science.

I've attached a sample dataset of some of the fossil measurements I've collected, along with a document outlining the specific statistical analyses I'd like to perform. The dataset includes measurements of various anatomical features, such as limb lengths, skull dimensions, and tooth sizes, as well as information about the geological context of each specimen.

The main analyses I'm interested in are:

1. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, etc.) for each anatomical feature, broken down by taxonomic group and geological formation.
2. Principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of morphological variation within and among taxa.
3. Phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the specimens, based on their morphological data.

I'd also like to be able to visualize the data in various ways, such as scatterplots, histograms, and phylogenetic trees.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information. I'm happy to provide more details about my research and the geological context of the specimens.

Thanks again for your help, and I look forward to working with you on this project!

Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairway
but that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the
variance.  I appreciate your efforts.

By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?

Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,
the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression
that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful
suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition
forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new
space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use
the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the
existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that
is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be
used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would
not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the
playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could
slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a
large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.
>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your
drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below
the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the
driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house
so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen
to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I
think opening the dining room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in
exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest
something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me
to try and sketch out these ideas.

Phillip

Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq.   Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.  
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position).   
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.    
  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the ""stick"" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).  This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.   

 So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  

Please let me know your thoughts

Subject: Exciting collaboration opportunity

Hi David,

It was great meeting you at the climate change conference a few months ago. I really enjoyed our conversation about the impacts of sea level rise on coastal regions and the potential for combining our expertise in history and climate science.

I've been thinking about our discussion and had an idea for a research project that I think you might be interested in. I'm proposing we collaborate on a study examining the impacts of sea level rise on significant cultural heritage sites along the Australian coastline. I believe that by combining our knowledge and skills, we could produce a unique and impactful study that contributes to the preservation of these important sites.

I'd love to discuss this further with you and hear your thoughts on the idea. Please let me know if you're interested in exploring this collaboration opportunity.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Upcoming Conference Panel

Michael,

That sounds like a great plan. I'll start working on the social factors and how they contributed to the growing divisions between the North and the South. I think it's crucial to highlight the role of abolitionist movements and the underground railroad in shaping public opinion and creating tensions between the two regions.

I'll also look into the cultural differences between the North and the South, such as the importance of honor and family in Southern society, and how these values influenced the region's response to Northern criticism of slavery.

Please let me know if you need any assistance with the economic aspects of the presentation. I have some resources that might be helpful for your research.

I'll send you a draft of my portion by the end of next week. We can then review each other's work and make any necessary revisions before submitting the final version to the conference organizers.

Thanks for your collaboration on this project. I'm confident that our combined efforts will result in a compelling and informative presentation.

Best regards,
Emily",research,No

What a fantastic idea! I'm thrilled that you reached out, and I would absolutely love to collaborate with you on this project. I think it's a wonderful way to make history and geography more relatable and exciting for my students.

I particularly like your idea of exploring the history of Thanksgiving dishes and the geography of chocolate production. Those are both topics that I know my students would be fascinated by, and I think hands-on experiments would be a great way to engage them in the learning process.

I would be happy to share some of my lesson plans with you and work together to develop content that aligns with my curriculum. I'm also open to the idea of co-authoring some blog posts, if you think that would be helpful.

Kirk,

I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Robert,

I'm so glad you're as excited about this as I am. I've attached scans of some of the most fascinating texts from the manuscript. Take a look at the word ""æðeling"" in Text 3 - it seems to have a different meaning than what we've previously understood.

I agree that we should apply for a grant. I have a few contacts at the Historical Linguistics Research Foundation who might be interested in funding our project. I'll reach out to them and draft a proposal.

Keep me posted on your thoughts and analyses of the texts. I can't wait to dive deeper into this research with you.

Dear Emily,

I've reviewed the case information you sent over, and I must say, it's quite a complex one. However, I'm confident that with some creative problem-solving and a few adjustments to your technique, we can develop a treatment plan that will work well for your patient.

During our call on Wednesday, I'd like to discuss the specific issues you've encountered and brainstorm some potential solutions. I've also been working on a research project related to new impression materials that might be applicable to this case, and I'd be happy to share some of my findings with you.

If you're interested, I could also send you some additional resources and case studies that might provide some valuable insights. Let me know if you'd like me to put together a few materials for you to review.

I'm looking forward to our call and working together to find the best solution for your patient. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then.

Subject: Seeking advice on teaching introductory econometrics

Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I've been having some difficulty with my introductory econometrics course. I recently received feedback from students that they're finding the material too difficult to understand, and I'm looking for ways to simplify the concepts without sacrificing the necessary technical details.

I know you have a reputation for being an excellent educator, and I was wondering if you had any advice on how I could improve my teaching methods. I've heard about a new teaching methodology that focuses on using real-world examples and case studies to teach econometrics, and I'm considering implementing it in my course. I would love to get your thoughts on this approach and whether you think it would be helpful for my students.

I know we have a meeting scheduled next week to discuss this further, but I wanted to get your initial thoughts before we meet. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or resources that you think might be helpful.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Dear Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I remember our meeting at the conference fondly. Your research project sounds fascinating, and I would be more than happy to discuss it with you further. In fact, I am currently organizing a symposium on the legacy of the British Empire in Australia, and I believe your work would make an excellent contribution to the event.

The symposium will take place in Sydney from September 15-17, and I would like to invite you to present your research findings. It would be an excellent opportunity to share your work with other scholars in the field and engage in fruitful discussions.

If you're interested in participating, please let me know, and I will send you more details about the event, including the submission guidelines and deadlines. I can also arrange accommodations for you during your stay in Sydney.

I look forward to hearing back from you and potentially collaborating on this exciting project.

Hey Ethan,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out and thank you again for mentioning the international conference on the history of science. I'm thrilled about the prospect of presenting our collaborative research to such a distinguished audience.

However, I must admit that I'm feeling a bit daunted by the idea of preparing for a presentation of this caliber. As you know, my primary focus has been on research rather than public speaking, and I'm not entirely sure how to effectively convey our complex ideas to a broad audience.

I was wondering if you had any advice or tips for crafting a compelling presentation that would engage both experts in our fields and those with a more general interest in the history of science. I would be immensely grateful for any insights you could share, given your extensive experience in teaching and public speaking.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions. I'm eager to make the most of this incredible opportunity and to do justice to the work we've done together.

Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. As the conference date approaches, I wanted to touch base with you regarding our presentation and travel plans. Have you had a chance to review the latest draft of our paper? I made a few revisions based on our last discussion and would love to hear your thoughts.

Also, have you booked your flights and accommodations yet? I was thinking we could coordinate our travel schedules to ensure we arrive in time for the pre-conference events. It would be great to catch up with our colleagues and attend some of the workshops before our presentation.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I'm looking forward to showcasing our work and the potential implications for our understanding of early human migrations and interspecies interactions.

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. It was great to meet you at the history teachers' conference last month and learn about your work on American geography and history. I think our curricula could complement each other nicely.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on an interdisciplinary project that connects World War II to American history and geography. I believe this approach could help our students better understand the global context of the war and its impact on the United States.

Please let me know if you're open to discussing this further. I'd be happy to share some of my initial ideas and hear your thoughts.

Best regards,

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1.    
that's all the juice i'll pay.

Subject: RE: ng views + wager

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

Subject: RE: Conference plans and presentation ideas

Hi Alex,

Your email got me really excited about our upcoming meeting and potential presentation! I love all three of your ideas, but I think the second one, ""Engaging Students through Unconventional Teaching Methods,"" might be the most accessible and engaging for our audience. We could each share a few examples from our own classrooms and then discuss the broader implications for interdisciplinary collaboration.

As for meeting up, I've reached out to a couple of my colleagues who I think would be really interested in our work. They're both passionate about innovative teaching methods and have experience with cross-curricular projects. Would you be available for dinner on the Friday evening of the conference? We could have a more casual conversation and brainstorm some ideas for moving forward.

I'm looking forward to seeing you soon!

Johnnie,

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen",corporate,Yes

Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled that you're interested in collaborating on a project. I think your idea of exploring the connections between chemistry and weather is fascinating and has the potential to engage a wide audience.

I particularly like the idea of creating a series of blog posts and videos that break down complex concepts in both our fields. We could even consider creating a joint webinar or workshop for students and educators to showcase our work and engage with the audience through interactive activities and Q&A sessions.

I'm happy to discuss the logistics of the project further. Perhaps we can set up a call next week to brainstorm content ideas and establish a timeline for the project.

I'm excited to work together and create something impactful for science education!

Subject: New Document Discovery

Hi Daniel,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some exciting news - I recently stumbled upon a previously unknown letter written by a Southern plantation owner in 1858. The letter discusses the economic impact of the proposed tariffs on the South and the growing tensions between the North and the South.

I think this document could be a game-changer for our research. It provides a unique perspective on the economic factors leading up to the Civil War. I'm attaching a scanned copy of the letter for you to review.

What do you think about incorporating this new information into our presentation for the Chicago conference? We might need to adjust our conclusions slightly, but I believe it will make our argument even stronger.

Let me know your thoughts.

I was thinking we could schedule a video call to go over the lesson plan one more time and make sure we're both on the same page before we implement it in our classrooms.

That's great that you've been reaching out to potential partners. I'd love to hear more about the responses you receive. I agree that the field trip to the environmental center would be a great addition to the project. I'll reach out to the center to see if they'd be willing to host a group of students.

I've also been thinking about how we can incorporate more geometry concepts into the project. I was thinking we could have students use geometric shapes to create models of sustainable buildings. What do you think?

I'll keep you posted on any updates from the funding agency. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we'll hear back soon!

Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with

We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a

Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are

Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Hey Samira,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our conversation regarding presenting our women's rights curriculum at the National Conference for History Educators. I believe our project could make a significant impact on how history is taught in schools across the country.

I've looked into the conference details, and the submission deadline is in two weeks. We should start working on our proposal and presentation outline. I think we should highlight the unique aspects of our curriculum, such as the focus on intersectionality and the inclusion of diverse women's narratives.

Let me know your thoughts and availability for a call to discuss this further. I'm excited about the possibility of sharing our work with a wider audience!

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

Thank you so much for the resources! I watched the Khan Academy videos and they were really helpful. I'd definitely appreciate if you could send over those practice problems with solutions.

One thing I'm still a bit confused about is the difference between longitudinal and transverse waves. I know that longitudinal waves move in the same direction as the wave, while transverse waves move perpendicular to the direction of the wave. But I'm not sure how this applies to sound waves. Are sound waves longitudinal or transverse?

Dear Jordan,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we last spoke, but I wanted to share some exciting news with you regarding the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

As you know, our team has been working tirelessly to analyze the data collected by the JWST, and we've made a groundbreaking discovery that I believe will have significant implications for our understanding of the early universe and galaxy formation.

I don't want to reveal too much in this email, but suffice it to say that the data has provided us with unprecedented insights into the properties and evolution of galaxies in the early universe. We've submitted a paper detailing our findings, and I'd be happy to share a preprint with you once it's available.

I was hoping we could schedule a video call to discuss this discovery in more detail and explore the potential for collaboration on a follow-up study. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the implications of our findings and how we might build upon them in future research.

Please let me know your availability for a call in the coming weeks. I'm excited to catch up and dive deeper into this fascinating topic with you.

I will reach out to our marketing team to discuss the production of these videos.

I have also been thinking about the lectures and workshops we want to organize in conjunction with the exhibition. I suggest we invite Dr. Tanaka from the University of Tokyo and Dr. Lee from the National Museum of China as guest speakers. Their expertise in Meiji-era art and Chinese influences would be invaluable to our audience.

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some exciting news with you regarding our project. I recently came across a rare stamp that is linked to a significant event in our city's history. It's called the ""Centennial Exposition Stamp"" and was issued in 1876 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city's founding.

I think this stamp could be a great addition to our digital archive and possibly even a focal point for our presentation at the local history club meeting. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on this and how we can incorporate it into our project.

Also, I've been doing some research on the psychological impact of historical events on communities and would love to share my findings with you. It might provide some interesting insights for our project.

Let me know when you're free to meet up and discuss this further. I'm thinking we could meet at our usual spot, The Brew House, this Saturday afternoon if that works for you.

the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

Subject: RE: Exciting manuscript discovery!

Emily,

I've been poring over the texts you sent, and I think we may need to reconsider our understanding of the Proto-Germanic verb system. The conjugations in Text 5 don't align with what we thought we knew.

However, I have a theory that could explain the discrepancies. If we consider the possibility of a previously unknown Proto-Germanic dialect influencing the development of Old English, it could account for these variations.

What do you think? I'd love to hear your perspective on this.

Also, I've made some progress on the grant proposal. With your contacts at the HRLF, I think our chances of securing funding are good.

Best,

Subject: RE: Advice on teaching hydrogen unit

Hi Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad you're looking to incorporate more real-world applications into your general chemistry curriculum. Hydrogen is a fascinating element with many important applications, and I'd be happy to help you design an engaging unit for your students.

One activity that I've found effective is a hands-on demonstration of hydrogen production using electrolysis. Students can use a simple setup with water, electrodes, and a power source to generate hydrogen gas, which they can then collect and observe. This helps them understand the process of electrolysis and the properties of hydrogen gas.

Another important aspect to cover is the role of hydrogen in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells. You could introduce the concept of hydrogen fuel cells and discuss their potential as clean energy sources. There are many online resources and videos that showcase how fuel cells work and their applications in various industries.

Lastly, I recommend incorporating some historical context by discussing the discovery of hydrogen and its significance in the development of chemistry. This can help students appreciate the importance of the element and its impact on scientific progress.

I'd be happy to lend you some resources and demonstration materials if you'd like. Let me know if you want to meet up and discuss this further. I'm free next Tuesday after lunch if that works for you.

Best,
Michael",research,No

Sorry it's been so long since I could respond.  With the craziness here I am 
way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  
#3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.  
calendar 2009-2013  very rare that it trades.

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and 
preliminary answers.  The answers are attempts by our group, Bob Crane and 
Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you.  Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well?  I could not find these numbers.  These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the 
pulp, paper and steel net works fund.  They are in their final stages of due

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of ""price discovery"" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

Jerry,

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  Will the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Thank you,
 
Phillip

Subject: RE: Research on manipulatives in algebra instruction

Hi Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about this topic, as I've been experimenting with using manipulatives in my classroom quite a bit lately. In fact, I've recently started using 3D printing to create custom manipulatives tailored to specific algebra concepts.

I've found that these custom manipulatives have been particularly effective in helping students visualize and understand abstract algebraic concepts. For example, I created a set of 3D printed tiles representing different polynomial terms, which students can manipulate to learn about combining like terms and understanding the structure of expressions.

My students have responded very positively to using these manipulatives, and I've noticed a significant improvement in their understanding of algebraic concepts. I'd be happy to share more details about my experiences and even send you some pictures of the manipulatives I've created.

I'm curious to learn more about your research project and the specific aspects of manipulative use you're investigating. Perhaps we could collaborate on this further, and even consider submitting a joint proposal for a presentation at the next conference.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or if there's any other way I can support your research.

The following are the prices you requested.  Unfortunately we are unwilling
to transact at these levels due to the current market volatility, but you
can consider these accurate market prices:

May01-Oct01 Socal/Juan offer:  8.70 usd/mmbtu

Apr02-Oct02 Socal/Juan offer:  3.53 usd/mmbtu

Our present value mark to market calculations for these trades are as
follows:

May01-Oct01 30,000/day @ 0.5975 =  $44,165,200

Apr02-Oct02 @  0.60 =  $5,920,980
Apr02-Oct02 @  0.745 =  $5,637,469
Apr02-Oct02 @  0.55 =  $3,006,092

Dear Dr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Emily, a student in your History of the Pilgrim Fathers and the Mayflower Voyage class. I've been really enjoying the course material, but I have some questions and concerns about the perspective being presented.

As someone interested in social policy and economic inequality, I'm curious about how the Pilgrim Fathers' journey and the establishment of the Plymouth colony may have impacted the indigenous populations and contributed to systems of inequality that persist today. I would love to discuss this further and learn more about your perspective on the topic.

If you have any recommended readings that present a different viewpoint, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm eager to engage with the material more deeply and understand the historical context from various angles.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to ""what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?"" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the ""I don't want any surprises"" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team (""I 
don't see a problem here...""), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for ""credit"", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to ""lean on"" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Emily,

Thank you so much for your kind words and offer of support. It means a lot to know that I have a colleague like you who understands the challenges of teaching and is always willing to lend a hand.

I'm excited to see your list of technology tools and add my own. I think this will be a valuable resource not just for our conference session, but for our own teaching as well. I'll keep an eye out for your email.

In the meantime, I'll start working on the growth mindset section for the proposal. I think I have some good ideas to contribute, but I'll definitely run them by you before finalizing anything.

Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip

Subject:	Answer 

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Jennifer,
I just checked with Carolyn on your invoicing for the conference.  She 
verified the 85K was processed.

George,

I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send 
it this morning.  

We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment 
would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more
advantageous to convey the partnership.

Also, I would like to speak to Hugo today.  I didn't find a Quattro 
Engineering in Buda.  Can you put me in contact with him.

Talk to you later.

Jeff,

I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.

 Due to the changes in the timetable for CS courses, two of my major courses are clashing. Professor Jhawar informed us that we will have to drop one off our major courses and opt for it next sem. So I would like to drop my Computer Architecture course (CS-204).

Julie,

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

Subject: RE: STEM Education Event Follow-up

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I enjoyed our conversation at the event as well. I'm always eager to connect with fellow educators and professionals who are passionate about STEM.

I would definitely be interested in keeping in touch and exploring the intersections between our work. In fact, I recently published a paper on a new catalyst that improves the efficiency of solar cells, and I think some of the concepts could be visualized using geometric principles. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that.

I'm also intrigued by the idea of collaborating on a project related to STEM education. If you have any ideas or opportunities in mind, please let me know. I'd be happy to contribute my expertise in any way I can.

I'm looking forward to continuing our discussion. Let's plan to grab that coffee soon!

Best regards,

Phillip,

I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the
room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for
the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding
storage.

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?

Thank you for your help.

Hi Mark,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about ways to incorporate more real-world applications into my math lessons, and I thought of you and your civic education classes. Would you be interested in collaborating on a project where my students use coding to simulate a democratic election, and your students learn about the math behind voting systems?

I think it could be a great way for our students to learn from each other and see how different subjects can work together. Let me know what you think!

Dear Dr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the progress of our NSF grant application. I have completed the literature review section and outlined the preliminary results from our recent experiments. Please find the updated draft attached for your review and feedback.

Additionally, I have been in contact with Dr. Schneider's research group from the University of Zurich. They have provided some valuable insights and suggestions for our project, which I believe will strengthen our proposal. I have incorporated their feedback into the draft.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss the grant application in more detail and finalize the budget? Please let me know your availability.

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?
Brenda

Subject: RE: Help with math concepts for new lesson plan

Emily,

I think your lesson plan outline sounds great! Starting with the historical context and then introducing the Enigma machine and its significance is a good way to engage the students and provide them with the necessary background information.

I can definitely create some encrypted messages for the students to decipher using modular arithmetic and congruences. We can even make it a competition or a team activity to see who can crack the code first!

One suggestion I have is to maybe include a brief explanation of how the Enigma machine works and its inner workings. I think the students would find it interesting to see the actual machine and understand the mechanical and mathematical principles behind it.

Let me know if you need any help with the historical aspects of the lesson plan as well. I'd be happy to assist in any way I can.

Emily,

Thank you so much for your generous offer! The resources you've put together sound perfect for helping my students grasp the importance of the Silk Road. I'm particularly excited about the curriculum guide, as it will provide a structured way for my students to explore the topic.

I'd love to schedule a time for you to come to my classroom and give a brief presentation on the Silk Road, perhaps touching on some key aspects that you think will be most relevant to the exhibit. This would really help set the stage for their visit and get them excited about what they'll be seeing.

Additionally, I've been thinking more about incorporating mindfulness and meditation practices into my teaching, as we discussed before. Do you have any suggestions for how I could tie these practices into our study of the Silk Road? I think it could be a powerful way to help my students connect with the material on a deeper level.

Thanks again for all your support. I'm looking forward to collaborating with you on this project!

Jordan,

I'm glad the timing works for you and your students. I'll see you on Tuesday!

Your lesson plan on the different roles in space missions sounds fantastic. I'd be happy to share my perspective and discuss how amateur astronomers can contribute to the space exploration community. In fact, I've been involved in a few citizen science projects where amateur astronomers collaborate with professional researchers to analyze data and make discoveries. I think this could be a great way to show your students that they don't have to be professional scientists to make a difference in the field.

I'll also share some stories about the incredible women and men who work on missions like Juno, highlighting the diverse backgrounds and skill sets that come together to make these missions possible. I think this could help your students see themselves in these roles and inspire them to pursue their passions in STEM.

If you're interested, I could also bring my telescope to school one evening and give your students a hands-on experience observing the night sky. It would be a great way to cap off our discussion and give them a tangible connection to the wonders of space.

Let me know what you think about these ideas, and if there's anything else I can do to support your lesson plan.

In the meantime, I've been thinking about some additional activities we could include in our project. I attached a document with some ideas - let me know what you think.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts,

My interpretation of this is that we made $1.2Bn total, half from new deals and the other half from reserve releases, and when you back out the prudency release you get back to zero net curve shift for 2001, which is what the original file had (approximately)

To confirm the pricing of the LNG dela::

I can show a $3.01 bid for the Nymex portion of 160,000 mmbtu/day for the 
time period Jan 2003-Dec 2014.  The bid on Henry Hub basis for same time 
period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis 
is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925.

Notional volume = 70,128 contracts.
PV volume = 37,658 contracts.
Exposure per $.01 move = $3,760,000

Hi Mark,

That sounds great! I'm free next Tuesday afternoon if you're available for a call. I'll send you a calendar invite.

In the meantime, I've been doing some research on sustainable design and came across an interesting article on the economic benefits of green buildings. I thought you might find it useful:

What do you think? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how we can incorporate these ideas into our course.

Talk to you soon,

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Multicultural Storybook Project Update

Hi Daniel,

I hope you're having a great week so far! I wanted to touch base with you regarding our multicultural storybook project. The students have been making fantastic progress on their pages, and I'm thrilled with the diversity of cultures and stories they've chosen to represent.

I've been thinking about the layout of the storybook and how we can best showcase each student's work. Do you have any thoughts or suggestions? I'd love to hear your ideas!

Also, have you had a chance to finalize the date and time for our multicultural music and storytelling event? I want to make sure we give our students and their families enough notice to plan accordingly.

Looking forward to hearing back from you and continuing to collaborate on this exciting project!

Best regards,

Lucy,

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Dear Emily,

I'm glad to hear that you and your students are eager to explore the resources I'll be sharing. Understanding the genetic factors behind disease susceptibility and resistance is indeed a crucial aspect of our work, and I'm happy to provide more information on that topic.

The project idea you described sounds fantastic. I'll be sure to send over a dataset that your students can work with to create their visualizations. I'm confident that their work will help make our research more accessible to a wider audience.

As for the guest lecture, the week of May 10th works perfectly with my schedule. I'll be happy to join your class via webinar at 10:00 AM CST on a date that suits you best. Please let me know which day within that week would be most convenient for you and your students.

Regarding the virtual science fair, I would be delighted to be your keynote speaker. It's an honor to be considered, and I'm always eager to engage with the next generation of scientists. I look forward to discussing the details with your organizing committee.

Thank you once again for reaching out and for your commitment to providing your students with valuable learning experiences. I'm excited to collaborate with you and your class, and I'm confident that this partnership will be mutually beneficial.

Hey Jordan,

I hope this email finds you well! I remember you mentioned that you were planning a unit on space exploration for your students. As promised, I've compiled some resources that you might find useful for your lesson plans.

I've attached a folder containing the latest images and data from our observations of Jupiter and its moons, particularly Io. You'll find high-resolution images, detailed maps, and some fascinating information about the unique geological features and volcanism on Io. I've also included a few articles and research papers that I thought might be accessible and engaging for your students.

Please feel free to use these materials in any way that suits your needs. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the content, just let me know. I'm always happy to help!

Subject: RE: Inquiry about philosophical influences on the Alaska Purchase

Dear Elena,

Thank you for reaching out, and apologies for the delayed response. Your research on the Alaska Purchase and its connection to the philosophical ideas of the time is fascinating. I would be delighted to discuss this further and explore the potential for collaboration.

I believe that the works of Spinoza, Hobbes, and Machiavelli could indeed have had a significant influence on the decision-making processes of the key figures involved in the purchase. Spinoza's ideas on the nature of the state and the role of reason in politics, Hobbes' concept of the social contract, and Machiavelli's pragmatic approach to power dynamics could all provide valuable insights into the motivations and strategies employed by the Russian and American negotiators.

I have a few resources that might be helpful for your research, and I would be happy to share them with you. Additionally, I think that our collaboration could lead to a compelling joint paper that explores the intersection of philosophy and history in this specific context. We could potentially present our findings at the upcoming interdisciplinary conference on ""Philosophy and History: Reexamining the Past Through Multiple Lenses.""

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal, and if you're available for a meeting to discuss the project further.

Best regards,

Emily,

Thank you for your quick response and for sharing your initial questions. I'll do my best to provide more context around the key features of our solution:

1. Data integrity and version control: Our solution leverages advanced checksum algorithms to ensure data integrity throughout the archiving process. We also provide a robust version control system that allows users to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.

2. Data retrieval and access: We have designed our solution to be highly interoperable with existing data analysis tools. We offer a range of APIs and connectors that enable seamless integration with popular platforms like Python, R, and SQL. Users can also access their archived data through a user-friendly web interface.

3. Data governance and compliance: Our solution includes built-in features for data governance and compliance, such as role-based access control, audit trails, and retention policies. We also offer a range of certifications and accreditations to ensure that our solution meets the highest standards for security and privacy.

I'd be happy to dive into more technical details on a call. Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work for you? I'm available most of the day.

Best,

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Dear Rajesh,

It was great meeting you at the International Language Instructors' Conference in Berlin last month. I was impressed by your presentation on innovative approaches to Tamil language curriculum design, and I think we could benefit from sharing ideas and collaborating on our respective courses.

I'm currently working on redesigning my Swedish language and culture course to better engage students and improve their language acquisition. I'd love to hear more about the strategies you've implemented in your Tamil courses and discuss potential ways we could incorporate each other's ideas.

Would you be interested in setting up a video call to discuss this further? I'm free next week on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning, if that works for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Tuesday afternoon works great for me. Let's schedule our call for 2 pm EST. I'll send you a Zoom link closer to the date.

I completely agree about emphasizing the student-centered approach in our proposal. It's a crucial aspect of our curriculum, and it will showcase how our work empowers students to engage with history in a more meaningful way.

I'm also thinking about potential challenges we might face during the presentation, such as pushback or questions about the relevance of teaching women's rights and social justice in history classes. We should be prepared to address these concerns and highlight the importance of inclusive education.

Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

I read through the data request.  We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.  We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.  Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.  I would  like to review the final product before it is submitted.

Jeff,

JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.  

Phillip

Subject: Inclusive Soccer Program Update

Hey Jamie,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you an update on the inclusive soccer program we've been working on. We've made some great progress, but we're facing a few challenges that I think we should discuss.

First, the good news: we've secured the grant funding we needed to get the program off the ground! The grant committee was impressed with our proposal and the potential impact our program could have on students with and without disabilities.

However, now that we're in the implementation phase, we're running into some scheduling conflicts. It's been difficult to find a time when both our schools can have students available for the program. I was wondering if you had any ideas for how we could work around this issue.

Another challenge we're facing is finding volunteers to help with the program. We need people who are knowledgeable about adaptive sports and can assist our students during practices and games. Do you have any suggestions for where we could find reliable volunteers?

I know we've got a lot to figure out, but I'm confident that we can make this program a success. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these challenges and any ideas you might have for overcoming them.

Let me know when you have a chance to chat,

Dear Dr. Klein,

I am thrilled to hear that you are as enthusiastic about our potential collaboration as I am. I completely agree that our respective fields can offer unique and valuable perspectives on the concept of resilience in the face of catastrophic events.

As for our video conference call, I would be available next Tuesday, April 12th, at 10:00 AM my time (Pacific Daylight Time). If this works for you, please let me know, and I will send you a meeting invite with the video conferencing details.

In the meantime, I have been thinking about the conference organizers' request for a proposal for a joint session at next year's conference. I believe that our paper on resilience could form the basis for an engaging and thought-provoking session. We could explore the parallels between geological and historical cataclysmic events and how humans have adapted and persevered in the face of these challenges. We could also discuss the implications of our findings for contemporary society and the challenges we face today.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea and any suggestions you may have for the joint session proposal. Please feel free to share any other ideas or topics you think would be worth exploring in our collaboration.

I look forward to our call next week and to further discussing our exciting collaboration.

Thank you so much for your thoughtful and detailed response. Your suggestions make a lot of sense, and I'm excited to try them out with my students. I especially like the idea of incorporating team-building activities and goal-setting exercises. I think that could make a real difference in helping them develop a sense of purpose and unity.

In fact, we have a big soccer tournament coming up next month where my students will have the opportunity to showcase their skills and progress. I think it will be a great opportunity to put some of your strategies into action and see how they respond.

Thanks again for your help and support. It means a lot to have a colleague like you to turn to for advice and guidance.

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some exciting news with you – our paper on the environmental impact of dental products has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Environmental Health!

This is a huge accomplishment, and I couldn't have done it without your expertise and collaboration. I'm so proud of the work we've done together and the impact it will have on both the dental and environmental communities.

I've been invited to speak at the upcoming Green Dentistry Conference to present our findings. I would love for you to join me as co-presenters. It would be a great opportunity to share our research with a wider audience and network with other professionals in the field.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my

HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form
         factor first and live with the compromises.
         (Or just stick with separate gadgets.)

Hi Olivia,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our conversation at the arts education conference and wanted to run an idea by you. I'm planning to do a unit on cultural and musical influences in art with my kindergarten class, and I thought it might be fun to do a cross-school art exchange with your class. 

The idea would be for each class to create a piece of art inspired by a different culture or musical genre, and then we could swap the artwork and have a video call to discuss our interpretations and experiences. I think it could be a great way to expose our students to diverse perspectives and encourage them to think critically about art.

What do you think? Would you be interested in collaborating on this project? I'd love to hear your thoughts and any ideas you might have for making it even better.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

John,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these ""portable pipeline"" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few ""portable pipelines"" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. ",corporate,No

Hi Dr. Carlisle,

It was such a pleasure meeting you at the World Stamp Show last week. I really enjoyed our conversation about the history of postal services and philately. Your presentation on the impact of the postal system on 19th-century communication was fascinating!

I hope you had a smooth journey back to London. The conference was quite an experience, wasn't it? I've been to a few of these events before, but this one was by far the largest and most impressive.

I'd love to stay in touch and perhaps collaborate on some research projects in the future. If you come across any interesting stamps or postal history artifacts from your side of the pond, please do let me know. I'm always on the lookout for new additions to my collection.

I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high.  
That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 
151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.

   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It 
wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.  
Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.

contmaplating buying some 4.00 puts for lat 2nd q or early 3q for a few 
pennies.

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.

Liam,

Great suggestions for additional readings! I've added them to the syllabus. I also like your idea of incorporating a debate or discussion component into the course. It would be a good way for the students to practice their critical thinking and argumentation skills.

I was thinking we could have the students debate topics such as:
1. The morality of using animals for food, clothing, and medical research
2. The role of individual responsibility vs. government regulation in environmental protection
3. The impact of cultural traditions on animal welfare practices

What do you think? Do you have any other ideas for debate topics?

I'm also thinking about how we can incorporate some non-traditional teaching methods into the course. Maybe we could have the students do a field trip to a local farm or wildlife sanctuary, or invite guest speakers from different cultural backgrounds to share their perspectives on environmental and animal welfare issues.

Let me know your thoughts!

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our
customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell
blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant
see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right
now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Thank you for thinking of me for this opportunity. I agree that our previous collaboration was successful, and I'm intrigued by the idea of working together again on this important topic.

I would definitely be interested in discussing this further. How about we meet at the campus café next Tuesday around 10:30 AM? That should give us enough time to brainstorm some ideas before my afternoon classes.

Please let me know if that works for you, and feel free to bring along any initial thoughts or materials you have on the project.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the 
closing statement or on some other document.

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the 
deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on 
the deal.  
Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical 
deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for sending over the latest draft of the project proposal. I've reviewed it and think you've done an excellent job outlining our goals and the potential impact of the game-based learning tool.

Regarding the game mechanics, I was thinking about incorporating some sort of reward system where children earn points or badges for completing certain tasks or reaching milestones in their hearing management. This could help motivate them to stay engaged with the game and reinforce positive habits.

I'd also like to explore ways to make the game adaptive, so that it can adjust the difficulty level based on the child's progress and individual needs. This could help ensure that the game remains challenging and effective for a wide range of children with different abilities and learning styles.

Let me know what you think about these ideas, and if you have any other suggestions for making the game as effective and engaging as possible.

I'm thrilled to report that our grant proposal has been accepted! This is a huge step forward for our research and a testament to the strong case we made for the importance of studying the long-term impacts of catastrophic geological events.

I've been in touch with my department head, and they are fully supportive of this collaboration. We can start making arrangements for me to visit your field site at Mount Etna and for you to come to Mount Rainier. I think being able to collect data and samples together will be invaluable for our study.

In the meantime, I'll start working on the preliminary data analysis from the papers we've exchanged. I have a few ideas for how we can structure our comparative analysis, which I'd love to run by you.

Thank you for being such a wonderful collaborator and friend throughout this process. I have no doubt that our work together will lead to important discoveries and advancements in our field.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Subject: RE: Grand Opening Event Planning

Emily,

The draft invitation and press release look great! I've made a few minor edits and suggestions, which I've highlighted in the attached documents. Feel free to modify them as you see fit.

I've reached out to the local media outlets, and the response has been very positive. I'm confident we'll have good coverage for the event.

As for the event schedule, I was thinking we could start with a welcome speech from you and me, followed by the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After that, we could have guided tours of the center and the interactive activities for the children. What do you think?

Looking forward to our call on Monday to finalize the details.

Best,
Alex",research,No

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Daniel,

I'd be happy to take a look at your project outline! It sounds like a fascinating angle to explore. Please feel free to send it my way whenever you're ready.

As for ""sus,"" I've definitely heard it used by my students. It's interesting to see how quickly these terms spread across different age groups and regions. I wonder if social media is the main driver or if there are other factors at play.

I look forward to seeing your outline and discussing this further!

Hi Alex,

The Trailhead Café sounds perfect – I love that place! 2 pm works great for me. I'm really looking forward to our brainstorming session.

A field trip to a local geological site is an amazing idea! It would give students a chance to see the real-world impact of climate change and hopefully inspire them to take action. I've been thinking about how we can make the trip both educational and engaging. Maybe we could have the students collect data or samples and then analyze them back in the classroom?

I'll start looking into potential sites and any necessary permissions we might need. Let's discuss the details on Tuesday!

See you soon,

Hi Emily,

Thanks for the update! I'm glad to hear that the meeting with the publisher went well. I'll take a look at the magnetic storage chapter and provide my feedback by the end of the week.

I've been doing some research on the impact of cloud computing on data storage and preservation, and I think it would make for an interesting chapter. I can start working on an outline if you'd like.

Also, I wanted to remind you that we have a podcast recording scheduled for next Tuesday. The topic is ""The Future of Data Storage: Trends and Predictions."" Let me know if you have any ideas for discussion points or potential interviewees.

Looking forward to your thoughts on the cloud computing chapter idea!

Hi Sam,

Thanks for sharing that article! I've been swamped with field work lately, but I'm always eager to discuss spider communication strategies. 

It's fascinating how Salticids have evolved such complex chemical mimicry alongside their visual displays. In orb weavers, we see a lot of chemical communication in courtship and web-building, but nothing quite as elaborate as what you're describing.

I'd love to collaborate on a paper exploring the parallels and differences between chemical communication in jumping spiders and orb weavers. Maybe we could even get some funding to do a comparative study?

I'm free to chat next week if you want to brainstorm ideas.

Dear Anjali,

Thank you for reaching out and offering to be a guest lecturer for our study abroad program in Hyderabad. We are excited about the opportunity to have you share your expertise on the Telangana movement with our students.

Your insights will be invaluable in helping our students understand the historical and cultural context of the region they will be studying. We would be happy to schedule your lecture for the second week of the program, which will be in mid-June. Please let me know if this works for you.

Additionally, we would like to invite you to join us for a guided tour of some of the archaeological sites in the area. Your knowledge of the region's history would greatly enhance our students' experience.

Hey Liam,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying your new job at Genetech. It's been a while since we last touched base, and I wanted to reach out because I could really use your help with something.

I've been awarded a grant to develop a new genetics curriculum for high schools in our district, and I'm feeling both excited and overwhelmed by the task. I want to create something that's engaging and meaningful for students, but I also want to make sure it's up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a look at what I have so far and provide some feedback? I'd be especially interested in any insights you might have about the current state of genetics research and how it could be incorporated into the curriculum.

Let me know if you have any time in the next few weeks to chat or meet up. I'd be happy to treat you to coffee or lunch in exchange for your expertise!

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

 In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.

 The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

 Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

 As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

 $______ per/share

Kirk -

In regards to your response to move these reviews up and hopes to get the
ball rolling before Monday, November 26th - I will be sending you three
messages following this with the drafts of five topics that are ready for
SME review.
1) Options and Futures for Dutch Quigley
2) Forwards and Swaps for Andy Lewis
3) Organizational Structure for Berney Aucoin

I hope sending them in this manner will make it easier for you send to
Phillip and ultimately, the SMEs.

Our goal is to send you the following topics by EOD tomorrow:
1) Risk Identification and Commodity Fundamentals for Ed McMichael
2) Risk Management Inputs and Hedging Basics for Mark Reese

Reminder that Accounting & Reporting will be written by Errol McLaughlin
(from Jeff Gossett's group) and will not be complete until mid-December.

As far as storyline scripts are concerned, I am unable to send anything to
you prior to the EOD tomorrow. Unfortunately, our script writer can not get
them to us any sooner. Hopefully you can forward them to Legal for them to
see first thing Monday morning. I apologize for not being able to get them
to you sooner.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Good afternoon Kirk -

As a reminder, the following are upcoming reviews we will need from Enron.

**Scripts for Storyline Video:  These scripts will be ready for Enron Legal
to review first thing Monday morning after the holidays - Nov. 26th. Based
on our production shoot schedule and reserving the actors/actresses, we
would like these reviews completed by EOD Wednesday, but can have them no
later than EOD Thursday.  As I've mentioned before, these scripts should
not take more than two hours to review. Please let me know if there are any
issues with this timeframe as it will significantly impact our schedule as
well as the production house and hired actors/actresses' schedules. Thank
you.

Topic Content for the Knowledge System: We will have all but one of the
topics ready for SME review/edits first thing Monday morning - Nov. 26th.
As we discussed, I am hoping you can send these to Phillip for him to
forward on to the SMEs. We will be sending these topics to the following
SMEs for their review and edits.
     Risk Identification - Ed McMichael
     Commodity Fundamentals - Ed McMichael (waiting on one homework
assignment from him)
     Futures - Dutch Quigley
     Options - Dutch Quigley
     Swaps - Andy Lewis
     Forwards - Andy Lewis
     Risk Management Inputs - Mark Reese
     Hedging Basics - Mark Reese
     Organization Structure - Berney Aucoin (we are still missing content
for Mid-Marketer/Origination)

The last topic, Accounting and Reporting, will be developed later in the
process as Errol McLaughlin will be helping us write this througout the
first two weeks in December. Berney Aucoin will need to review this.

Emily,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm excited to collaborate with you on this presentation. I agree that combining our research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic and social factors leading to the Civil War.

Your suggestion to start by outlining the main differences between the North and the South is a great idea. We could then delve into the specific issues, such as the slave economy, industrialization, and westward expansion, and how these factors heightened tensions between the two regions.

I think it would also be valuable to discuss the role of politics in exacerbating these divisions, such as the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

If you're agreeable, I can start working on an outline for the presentation, focusing on the economic aspects, and you can tackle the social factors. We can then combine our work and refine it together.

Let me know if you have any other ideas or suggestions. I'm looking forward to working with you on this project.

Emily,

Thank you for your email and for taking the lead on the presentation slides. I agree that incorporating personal anecdotes is a great way to make our research more relatable and engaging. I have a story about a camping trip I took with my family last summer that I think would be perfect for the presentation. I'll draft up a short version and send it your way for feedback.

I also had an idea for a interactive activity we could do with the audience during the presentation. Since our research emphasizes the importance of spending time in nature, we could have attendees pair up and share their favorite outdoor activities or memories. This could help reinforce our message and create a more memorable experience for everyone.

Let me know what you think about this idea, and if you have any other suggestions for making our presentation even more impactful. I'm looking forward to seeing our hard work come to fruition at the conference!

JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES, PART 2: THE Q&A

    When I and 14 other journalists joined Microsoft's
         chairman for a private dinner after the Windows
         XP launch, he had a lot to say. In the second
         installment of this two-part story, Bill
         speaks out on XP's controversial activation
         technology, the company's upcoming tablet
         PC, wireless standards, and more.

    SEND IN THE REBATES! APPLE HOPING TO BOOST INTEREST IN IMACS

    Apple is hardly immune from the slowdown
    in hardware sales--and now we're seeing
    the rebates to prove it. The company
    is giving cash back--or free toys--to
    anyone who buys its computers from now
    through December, borrowing a tactic
    from its PC-selling brethren. But is
    it too little, too late?

  WHERE'S THE BEEF? AUDIENCES TIRED OF CEOS' EMPTY
  RHETORIC

   At a recent tech conference, Microsoft's
         Steve Ballmer and Sun's Scott McNealy played
         up the jokes, while HP's Carly Fiorina stuck
         to business. Can you guess who won the crowd's
         favor? David finds out that technology execs
         crave substance, not style.

  HOW CITRIX IS SHAKING OFF WORRIES OF A MICROSOFT
  INVASION

   Despite talk that Microsoft will encroach
         on its turf, software maker Citrix continues
         to deliver strong results. What's its secret?
         Larry explains why Citrix is one of the few
         companies that has been able to dance successfully
         with this 800-pound gorilla.

  NO THANKS, BILL. TRY 3 NON-MICROSOFT WAYS TO MANAGE
  PASSWORDS

   Sure, it's a pain trying to remember your username
         and password for the numerous Web sites you
         visit each day, but Microsoft's new Passport
         service is not the only solution. Preston
         digs up three programs that store and manage
         passwords--with no involvement from Redmond.

Subject: Solar Eclipse Event Collaboration

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, the community center is planning a special event to celebrate the upcoming solar eclipse. I think this is a fantastic opportunity for our history and science departments to collaborate and create something truly memorable for our community.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in meeting to discuss ideas for incorporating historical elements into the event. I think it would be fascinating to explore how eclipses have been viewed and interpreted by different cultures throughout history, particularly in the context of Texas-Mexico relations.

Please let me know if you have any initial thoughts or suggestions. I'm excited to work together on this!

Best regards,

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hi Nandini,

Thanks for your prompt response. I'm glad you're on board with the collaboration. Your suggestion to structure the paper around key historical events and movements sounds perfect. We can certainly draw interesting parallels between Telangana and Odisha.

Next week works well for me. How about Tuesday, 4:30 PM? I can set up a Zoom call. Please feel free to suggest another time if that doesn't suit you.

I've attached a few papers I thought might be relevant to our discussion. I'd be grateful if you could take a look and let me know your thoughts.

Looking forward to our call.

GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security
         systems are quite vulnerable. Add a second
         element, such as an ID card, and the solution's
         more secure. David looks at the promise--and

Mr. Nowlan:

When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff 
Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had 
been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if 
this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up 
with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark 
Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.

The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue 
discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel 
management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR 
analysis.  

In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I 
follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did 
you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look 
forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their 
attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 
or 4 persons; they will do the same.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)


We appreciate your suggestions.
Thank-you.

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on cache memory optimization project

Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out. I am glad to hear that you are finding the concepts from our course applicable to your project on cache memory optimization. It is an interesting and challenging problem, and I would be happy to provide some guidance.

In terms of mathematical modeling, I suggest you start by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable components. Consider the various factors that influence cache performance, such as cache size, block size, and replacement policies. You may find that techniques like Markov chains or queuing theory could be useful in modeling these aspects of the system.

I would be happy to meet with you to discuss your project further. How about we schedule a meeting for next Tuesday at 3 pm in my office? Please let me know if this works for you.

Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review.",corporate,No

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts. I appreciate your engagement with the course material and your desire to understand the historical context from various perspectives.

I would be more than happy to meet with you to discuss your questions and concerns further. Understanding the impact of the Pilgrim Fathers' journey on indigenous populations and systems of inequality is an important aspect of studying history.

As for recommended readings, I suggest looking into ""The Invasion of America"" by Francis Jennings and ""Mayflower"" by Nathaniel Philbrick. Both books offer a different perspective on the events surrounding the Pilgrim Fathers and the Mayflower voyage.

Please let me know when you're available to meet, and we can continue our discussion in person.

Dear Sarah,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about our recent discussion at the history club meeting about combining history and mathematics in puzzles. I believe we could create something truly unique and engaging for both our club members and a wider audience.

I have a vast collection of historical anecdotes and obscure records that could serve as the foundation for our puzzles. If you're interested, we could meet to brainstorm ideas and discuss how to incorporate your expertise in trigonometry and geometry.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to collaborate on this project.

I fully agree with the learning objectives you've outlined – they provide a clear and comprehensive foundation for the students to build upon. I believe that by achieving these objectives, we will have created a successful and impactful course.

I appreciate your offer to take the lead on the programming component, and I would be happy to focus on the chemistry side of things. This division of labor will allow us to create a well-rounded and cohesive course that effectively combines our expertise.

As we move forward with the course development, I suggest we schedule regular meetings to discuss our progress, share ideas, and ensure that the programming and chemistry components are well-integrated. I believe that our collaboration and shared vision for this course will result in a unique and engaging learning experience for the students.

Thank you for your enthusiasm and dedication to this project. I'm excited to work together and create something truly special for these young learners.

Best regards,

Great idea on the food vendors! I'll reach out to some of the local places and see if they're interested. A few of them have been very supportive of our community events in the past.

I'll send over the draft flyers and social media graphics by early next week for you to review. I'm also going to create a sign-up form for the kids who want to participate in the performances and research presentations.

Thanks for handling the park permits and rain date! I'll make sure to include that info on the promotional materials.

I'll be out of town next week for a family wedding, but I'll be available by email if you need anything. I'll make sure to have everything ready before I leave.

Amelia,

That's fantastic news about the keynote invitation! I would be honored to join you as a co-presenter at the conference. It's a wonderful opportunity to showcase our work and engage with the broader academic community.

I agree that the latest draft of our paper is in good shape, but I think we could still strengthen the conclusion by tying our findings more explicitly to the broader debates in the field. Perhaps we could highlight how our work contributes to the ongoing scholarly conversation about the role of religious institutions in shaping scientific discourse during this period.

On a personal note, I wanted to thank you for all your support and encouragement throughout this project. Balancing research and family life can be challenging, but knowing that I have a colleague like you in my corner makes all the difference.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Lucy,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

Alex,

Great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about this. I'd be happy to help in any way I can.

I remember the project I worked on a few years ago quite well. The biggest challenge was getting the two systems to communicate effectively, especially when it came to system calls and process management. I can share some of the strategies we used to overcome those hurdles.

I'm free for a call later this week if you'd like to discuss the specifics of your project. Just let me know what day and time work best for you.

On a separate note, I noticed you mentioned a recent hiking trip. I'm an avid hiker myself! I'd love to hear more about where you went and any recommendations you might have. I'm always on the lookout for new trails to explore.

Looking forward to catching up and helping out with your project!

Hi Emily,

It was great to meet you at the astronomy club meeting last night. I really enjoyed your presentation on the historical impact of celestial events on urban development. As someone who is passionate about space exploration and planetary science, I found your perspective fascinating.

I was particularly intrigued by your insights on how advancements in space technology have influenced urban development throughout history. It's a topic I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I'd love to continue our conversation.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to share some of the latest updates on the Cassini mission and the scientific discoveries that have come out of it. I think you might find it relevant to your work on historical disasters and urban transformation.

Let me know if you'd like to chat more about this or if you have any other ideas for collaboration. I'm always excited to connect with people who share my interests.

Hi Emily,

I love the idea! I think it's a great way to get students to think about physics concepts in a new and creative way, and it's a perfect opportunity for them to expand their vocabulary at the same time. I'm definitely on board to collaborate with you on this project.

I was thinking we could have the students work in small groups and give them a list of physics concepts and vocabulary words to choose from. That way, they can collaborate and bounce ideas off each other, and we can make sure that each group is working on a different concept and set of words.

We could also have them present their stories or poems to the class and explain how they incorporated the physics concept and vocabulary words. That would give them a chance to practice their presentation skills and get feedback from their peers.

Let me know what you think about these ideas, and we can start planning out the details of the project. I'm excited to work on this with you!

Jacques,

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

Hi Emily,

Thanks so much for reaching out! I'm excited to have connected with another teacher who is interested in integrating coding into math and science education. Your presentation on using spreadsheets to model exponential growth was really thought-provoking - I can definitely see how that could be adapted for use in my own classes.

I'd be happy to share some of the materials I've been using to teach coding concepts in my science classes. I've attached a couple of lesson plans that use Scratch to simulate different ecological relationships, like predator-prey dynamics and food webs. I've found that starting with these concrete, real-world examples helps students understand why coding and computational thinking are useful skills to have.

I'm also working on developing a series of activities that use Python to analyze and visualize data from our school's weather station. I'm still refining the curriculum, but I'm hoping to pilot it with my 8th graders next month. I'll keep you posted on how it goes!

I'd love to take you up on your offer to visit your school sometime. I'm actually going to be in the Ridgemont area for a conference in a couple of months. Maybe we could arrange for me to come by and do a guest lesson or activity with your students while I'm there?

Subject: RE: Following up from the Environmental Health Conference

Hi Olivia,

Tuesday at 2pm EST works for me. I'll keep an eye out for your calendar invite.

I think presenting at the Sustainable Forestry Conference is a great idea. It would be an excellent platform to share our work and get feedback from experts in the field. I'm happy to take the lead on putting together the proposal if you'd like.

In the meantime, I'll start gathering some data on Hantavirus cases in areas with different levels of forestry management. I think that could be a compelling piece of evidence for our presentation.

Looking forward to our call on Tuesday.

Best,
Ethan",research,No

Subject: Request for Feedback on Telangana Movement Chapter

Dear Nusrat,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you because I am currently working on a book about the Telangana movement, and I have just completed a chapter that I believe would benefit greatly from your insights.

The chapter focuses on the role of nationalism in the Telangana movement and draws parallels to other regional nationalist movements in South Asia. Given your expertise in the evolution and complexities of nationalism in Bangladesh, I would be incredibly grateful if you could take the time to review the chapter and provide your feedback.

If you are willing to help, I can send you the chapter draft by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Upcoming conference and joint presentation

Dear Dr. Stewart,

Thank you for reaching out. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, and I'm equally excited about our joint presentation. The topic is fascinating, and I believe our combined expertise will lead to a thought-provoking discussion.

Sharing a room is a great idea. It will give us more opportunities to brainstorm and refine our presentation. Plus, it'll be nice to have some company in the evenings after the conference activities.

I have a confession to make – I'm a bit of a dinosaur enthusiast. As a child, I watched ""Jurassic Park"" countless times and dreamed of being a paleontologist. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with someone who's made that dream a reality.

I look forward to meeting you in Cusco and embarking on this intellectual adventure together.

Best regards,
Marcus",research,No

trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30.  
They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Hi Alex,

Thanks so much for your email and for sending along your paper. I really enjoyed our chat as well and found your research totally fascinating. I'd love to learn more about what you and your team are working on, so I'll definitely take you up on that offer to visit your lab sometime. 

I'm also going to be writing a follow-up piece to the article I wrote about the conference, and I'd love to feature some of your work. Would you be open to answering a few more questions over email or Skype? I think my readers would be really interested in learning more about the implications of your research for understanding earthquake hazards.

Looking forward to staying in touch,

Subject: RE: Collaborating on integrating classical literature into electronics curriculum

Emily,

I'm delighted to hear from you and am thrilled by your interest in incorporating classical literature into your electronics curriculum. I firmly believe that the themes and lessons from works like the Aeneid can be applied to various fields and can greatly benefit students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

I would be more than happy to collaborate with you on this exciting venture. In fact, I have a few ideas in mind already! For instance, we could explore the theme of ""innovation and tradition"" by analyzing how Aeneas balances honoring tradition with embracing new ideas and technologies. This could tie in nicely with the concept of technological advancements in the electronics field.

I'm available to meet next week on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Please let me know which time works best for you, and we can further discuss our plans for this cross-disciplinary project.

Looking forward to working together,

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.  

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment 
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with 
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual 
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass 
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above 
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities 
such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong 
growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.

John

We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.  At some 
point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- 
perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

Mary,

I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3.  He agreed that it 
would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to 
#2.  Then they can just focus on #19.  I worked on the books this weekend but 
I need more time to finish.  I will call you in a day or so.

Subject: RE: Syllabus for CHEM/SOC 101

Emily,

Thank you for sharing the syllabus. I appreciate the thoroughness of your outline and the clear connections you've made between the scientific concepts and their real-world applications.

As I was reviewing the syllabus, I had a few thoughts on how we could incorporate more social studies and civic engagement elements into the course. I'd like to see if we can find ways to encourage students to critically examine the societal implications of the scientific advancements we'll be discussing, and to consider their own roles and responsibilities as citizens in relation to these issues.

For example, we could include case studies or discussion prompts that ask students to evaluate the ethical and social implications of certain scientific discoveries or technologies. We could also invite guest speakers from various fields (e.g., policy makers, activists, industry professionals) to share their perspectives and engage in dialogue with the students.

I'm happy to discuss these ideas further and work with you to revise the syllabus accordingly. Please let me know your thoughts!

Best,
Michael",research,No

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Dear Alice,

Thank you for reaching out, and congratulations on your fascinating research topic! I am delighted to learn about your work on the influence of Chinese philosophy on Faulkner's writing, and I would be happy to share my insights on the twenty-four solar terms and their potential symbolic significance.

Your focus on the ""eternal return"" and the cyclical nature of the seasons resonates with the core principles of the solar terms, which divide the year into 24 periods based on the sun's position and the lunar calendar. Each solar term represents a distinct phase in the seasonal cycle and is associated with specific agricultural and cultural practices.

I would be particularly interested in discussing the ways in which Faulkner may have engaged with these ideas, either directly or indirectly, and how they might manifest in his use of seasonal imagery and themes. Perhaps we could explore the connection between the solar terms and the structure of some of his works, such as the cyclical narrative in ""The Sound and the Fury.""

I am also intrigued by the possibility of co-authoring a paper or presenting at a conference together, as our research interests seem to complement each other nicely. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.

I look forward to our continued exchange and the insights we may uncover together.

Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

Jeff,

Per our conversation this morning, I will list the items in question.  I am
also forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to follow
up on as well.

* ACCOUNTING:  Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,
per contract
* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour reception
posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

Hi Ethan,

I completely agree with your suggestions for the professional development sessions. Handouts on the key instructional strategies and sample lesson/unit plans will be incredibly helpful for teachers. And I love the idea of incorporating interactive elements like role-playing and practice sessions. I think that will really help the teachers feel more confident and prepared to implement the curriculum.

You're welcome to take the lead on creating those training materials. I'll make sure the schools have the space and technology we need for those interactive components.

I heard back from both Jefferson and Washington - they're both on board to participate in the pilot! I'll coordinate with them on meeting dates and will send you the details once they're set.

Thanks again for all your partnership on this. I'm feeling really good about where we are and where we're headed!

Kim,

I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and 
possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to 
your efforts.  Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I 
want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.

For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement 
with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and 
today American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably a 
good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.  

I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work?  If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.  When would be good for you?  Please 
let me know!

Thank you,

Jeff

Greg,

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

Thanks for sharing your article draft. I really enjoyed reading it and found the analysis of resource extraction data particularly compelling. I think incorporating this kind of data into math lessons could be a great way to make the subject more concrete and relatable for students.

I'm definitely interested in exploring collaboration opportunities. How about we set up a video call next week to brainstorm some ideas? I'm free on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning, if either of those times work for you.

Dear Amelia,

Thank you for sending over the list of terms. I've taken a look and provided definitions and explanations for each one. I've attached the document for your review. Please let me know if you need any further clarification or have additional terms to add.

Your suggestions for my upcoming lecture are incredibly helpful. I particularly like the idea of using analogies and visual aids to make the concepts more relatable. I'll definitely incorporate those strategies into my presentation. And I appreciate the advice on breaking up the lecture and encouraging audience engagement. I tend to get carried away with the details, so reminding myself to step back and check for understanding will be key.

As for Ethan Chen, I do remember him! He was a few years ahead of me at Weston, but I recall him being a brilliant student with a real passion for physics. Small world that you know him as well.

I'm attaching a draft of my lecture outline. I'd greatly appreciate any feedback you might have, particularly on the clarity and flow of the content. And please feel free to share the document with Ethan if you think he might have insights to offer.

Thank you again for your help and collaboration on both the dictionary project and my lecture. I'm grateful for your expertise and support.

Dear Lila,

Thank you so much for your enthusiastic response and for sharing these thought-provoking ideas. I am excited to explore these themes further and to learn from your expertise.

I would like to invite you to contribute a piece to our exhibit catalog, which will feature essays and reflections from scholars and activists working on various aspects of displacement, resistance, and social justice. If you are interested, I would be honored if you could write about the potential impact of space exploration on indigenous land rights and cultural heritage sites, and how this relates to the broader history of displacement and colonization.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this invitation. I am happy to provide more details about the catalog and the exhibit.

I look forward to our continued collaboration and to creating a powerful and thought-provoking exhibit.

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Oliver,

Great, 2 pm at the café it is! I can't wait to dive deeper into our project and discuss the practical applications for our students. You make an excellent point about emphasizing the relevance of our work to politics and decision-making. We should definitely consider how to frame our presentation at the conference to make it engaging and thought-provoking for the audience.

I've been doing some research on recent controversies surrounding utilitarianism and its role in policy-making. I think incorporating some of these real-world examples could help illustrate the importance of our project and its potential impact. Let's brainstorm some ideas on Saturday.

See you then!

Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you about the upcoming paleontology conference where we've been invited to give a joint presentation. The organizers have asked us to submit a title and abstract for our talk by the end of the month.

I was thinking we could focus our presentation on the evolutionary relationships between Permian and Triassic reptiles, highlighting some of our recent findings from our collaborative research. What do you think? Do you have any specific aspects of our work that you'd like to showcase?

Also, we should start thinking about dividing up the work for the presentation. I'm happy to take the lead on creating the slides and outline, but I'd love your input on the content and any specific data or figures you'd like to include.

Let me know your thoughts, and we can schedule a call to discuss further if needed.

Hi Michael,

I love the idea of creating a companion website with additional resources! That will be a great way to supplement the video content and help students practice what they've learned. I can take on the task of creating the quizzes and practice problems.

I also think it would be a good idea to create a section on the website where students can ask questions and we can respond to them. This will help us engage with our audience and provide additional support.

As for the videos, I think we should aim to keep them around 10-15 minutes long, so that they're easy to digest. We can break down each topic into smaller subtopics and create separate videos for each one.

What do you think about this plan? I'm really excited to get started on this project!

     sure
     that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also
     enclosed
     is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of ""price discovery"" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

Amelia,

Tuesday at 10 AM EST works perfectly for me. I'm looking forward to our discussion and the opportunity to brainstorm ideas for our project.

Your suggestion to review the current literature on permafrost stability and planetary volcanism is an excellent starting point. I'll gather the latest research on permafrost and its implications for Earth's climate, and I'll be sure to include any relevant studies on other planets as well.

Thank you for the papers you've attached. I've skimmed through them, and they're incredibly informative. Your work on Io's volcanism is truly groundbreaking, and I can already see potential connections with permafrost research.

As for potential outlets, I agree that the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets and the Journal of Earth Science would be excellent choices. I also have a contact at the International Journal of Astrobiology who might be interested in our work, given the potential implications for life on other planets.

I'm attaching a few papers on permafrost degradation and its impact on Earth's climate. I thought they might provide valuable context for our project.

I'm eager to dive into this research and see where our collaboration leads us. Talk to you next Tuesday!

Subject: Following up from the Global Health Conference

Dear Dr. Chen,

It was great meeting you at the Global Health Conference last week. I really enjoyed our conversation about the potential link between WASH interventions and obesity prevention in developing communities. I've been thinking more about the ideas we discussed and would love to explore them further.

I did some research and found a few articles that support our hypothesis. For example, [this study](https://www.example.com/study) found that children in communities with poor sanitation were more likely to be stunted and have higher rates of obesity later in life. I think this could be a great starting point for our collaboration.

What do you think about conducting a joint research project on this topic? We could potentially do a study in one of the communities where WASH for All is already working. Let me know if you're interested, and we can set up a call to discuss further.

Best regards,
Sarah",research,No

Subject: Continuing our discussion on Kashmir

Aisha,

I enjoyed our spirited exchange during yesterday's research group meeting. While we may not see eye to eye on all aspects of the Kashmir conflict, I always appreciate your insightful and well-reasoned arguments.

I've been thinking more about the recent flare-up in violence and its potential implications for the region. As someone with deep knowledge of the historical and geopolitical context, I believe you could offer valuable perspective on this complex issue.

Would you be interested in collaborating on a paper analyzing the significance of the recent events and what they could mean for the future of the conflict? I think our different viewpoints, combined with our shared commitment to rigorous scholarship, could result in a thought-provoking and impactful piece.

Let me know what you think. I'm happy to discuss further and divide up the research and writing tasks in a way that plays to our respective strengths and interests.

Best regards,
Rajesh",research,No

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well! As I mentioned during our last dinner, I'm planning a trip to Europe this summer and would love to get your expert advice on some historical sites to visit. I'll be traveling to London, Paris, and Berlin, and I'm particularly interested in places that have significance in the history of medicine and infectious diseases.

I know you're incredibly knowledgeable about European history, and I would be so grateful if you could point me in the right direction. If you have any colleagues in those cities who might be willing to share their insights, I would be even more appreciative!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or resources to share. I'm getting excited about this trip and can't wait to learn more about the history of these incredible cities.

Dear Dr. Fitzgerald,

I hope this email finds you well. We met briefly at the science conference last month where you presented your fascinating research on cephalopods. I'm a high school math teacher and I was impressed by the mathematical aspects of your work, particularly the data analysis and modeling.

I was wondering if you would be interested in Skyping into my classroom to give a guest lecture on your research and how math plays a role in your findings. My students are currently learning about statistical analysis and graphing techniques, and I think hearing about a real-world application of these concepts would be incredibly valuable for them.

Please let me know if this is something you would be willing to do. I would be happy to work around your schedule and provide any necessary materials or resources.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay 
something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and 
a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock 
will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put 
up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the 
negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the 
utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Subject: RE: Upcoming conference in Rio

Lucas,

I'm getting more and more excited about our upcoming meeting and the potential for collaboration. Thank you for offering to introduce me to potential collaborators in Brazil – that would be incredibly helpful as I expand my research to include case studies of emerging economies.

I'll be staying at the Copacabana Palace Hotel, which I believe is not far from the conference venue. I'm arriving on the 9th and will be free most of the day on the 10th before the conference starts. Would you be available to meet for coffee or lunch that day? We could discuss our research ideas in more detail and start planning our grant proposal.

I'll be in touch with my flight details as the date approaches. Thank you again for all your help and support. I can't wait to experience Rio and work with you on this exciting project!

Best regards,
Emily",research,No

I've booked the rooms at the bed and breakfast, and they're all set for our arrival. I'll send you the confirmation details shortly.

Thanks for offering to drive! That would be great, as it will give me a chance to relax and enjoy the scenery on the way to Millersville. We can leave early and make a day of it, stopping for lunch or snacks along the way.

I'm really looking forward to our trip and the eclipse. It's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I couldn't ask for a better astronomy buddy to share it with.

See you soon!

Your Internet Banking accounts are now setup again for accessing. The
login id is still your main acct. # with the password being reset to the
last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the
primary account holder).  You will then be directed to a screen that
asks for information such as:
Name

City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire.  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive. One major change is the
wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and
not descriptions). You can change your account descriptions by clicking
on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.

We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly
(your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this
information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that
credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns.
Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is
correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).

We appreciate your patience and continued support. Our goal is to be
fully operational and all information corrected before the holiday

Jeff,

The value that we are looking for is the annual spend from ENA (trading 
floor) to have each trader access the Bridge Information System or Bridge 
Terminal.  We believe that Enron would get this backbone connectivity from 
Savvis.   This information is supplied by Bridge and has nothing to do with 
the WebFN transaction done by EBS.   Any thoughts on where we can find the 
annunal spend by ENA to gain access to the Bridge Terminals and their 
information - we thought that GSS might have the annual spend numbers.   

thanks for your help,

Subject: RE: Potential Collaboration

Dear Dr. Rivera,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind words. I, too, found our conversation at the conference to be thought-provoking and engaging. A research project exploring the connections between prehistoric fish weirs and 19th-century whaling techniques sounds like an excellent opportunity to merge our expertise and contribute to the understanding of human maritime history.

I am particularly intrigued by the idea of examining the cultural significance of these structures and how they have evolved over time. Combining our knowledge of ancient and more recent maritime practices could provide valuable insights into the ways in which humans have adapted to and impacted their environments.

I am excited to work with you on this project and believe that a co-authored paper or museum exhibit would be a fantastic way to showcase our findings. Please let me know the next steps in moving forward with this collaboration.

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Jacques,

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Phillip

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about visiting my workplace. I think you'd find it fascinating to see how a power plant operates and how we manage water treatment processes. It might even give you some ideas for your own sustainable farming practices!

If you're interested, I can arrange a tour for you next Friday afternoon, around 2 pm. Let me know if that works for you, and feel free to bring along any questions you might have.

Steve,

I need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.  Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.

Hi Michael,

I have some exciting news! The school has asked us to present our collaborative curriculum at the upcoming professional development workshop on innovative teaching methods for ESL teachers. This is a great opportunity to share our experiences and ideas with our colleagues.

The workshop will take place on Saturday, September 15th, from 9 am to 4 pm. Our presentation is scheduled for 1 pm, and we'll have 45 minutes to present and answer questions.

I think we should create a PowerPoint presentation highlighting the key aspects of our curriculum, student feedback, and the benefits of our collaborative approach. We can also prepare some handouts for the participants.

Let's meet next Wednesday at 3 pm to discuss our presentation and divide the tasks.

What do you think?

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

Bob,

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Subject: Sydney Olympics & IDRC


Planning to attend the Olympics in Sydney, Australia?

Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to 
experience some warm Aussie hospitality.

The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an 
opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one 
of our National Parks close to Sydney.

The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC 
International ""Wine & Wisdom"" event in the form of a Bush BBQ.  The time is 
4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some 
warm Aussie hospitality.

Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social 
or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail.  It's then up 
to you!

Sarah,

I've been analyzing the latest radar data for Hurricane Omar, and it looks like the storm is intensifying more quickly than we initially predicted. We need to update our forecast and issue a new warning for the areas along the East Coast.

Can you take a look at the data and let me know if you agree with my assessment? We should also discuss how we want to present this information to the public and to the media.

Hey Emily,

Thanks for sharing this exciting news! I've heard about metabolomics before, but I haven't had the chance to dive into the details. It sounds like a fascinating technique that could really advance our understanding of food chemistry.

I'm currently working on a project to develop a new food product with improved nutritional value. I've been struggling to find the right combination of ingredients, and I think metabolomics could be the key to unlocking the answers. By analyzing the metabolites in our prototype, we might be able to identify the specific compounds that contribute to its nutritional profile and make adjustments accordingly.

I'd love to collaborate with you on this project and explore the potential applications of metabolomics in our research. Maybe we could set up a meeting to discuss our ideas and plan our next steps?

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject:	Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential
Sensitivity:	Confidential

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,

Dear Liam,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share with you a recently published research article on nutrient cycles in local ecosystems that I thought might interest you, given your passion for environmental science.

The article discusses the impact of human activities on nutrient cycles and offers insights into potential solutions for mitigating these effects. I believe this could be a valuable resource for your studies and future endeavors in the field.

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss the article or if you have any questions about pursuing a career in environmental science. I'd be more than happy to provide guidance and support.

Things on my end have been pretty hectic. We're working on developing a new generation of speed sensors for electric vehicles, and it's been a challenging but exciting project. I've been spending a lot of time in the lab and attending conferences to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.

I was thinking, it would be great to catch up sometime. Maybe we could have a video call next week to discuss our work and share some of our experiences since graduation. Let me know if you're interested and when you're available.

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?",corporate,No

Gary,

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

As I was brainstorming ideas, I thought about your expertise in human geography and urban studies. I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on a cross-curricular project for our students?

I think it would be really valuable for our students to explore the relationship between urbanization and climate change. We could have them work together on a project that examines this topic and present their findings to the school and local community.

Let me know what you think! I'd love to brainstorm some ideas together.

Best,
Emily",research,No

Thank you so much for all of these incredible suggestions! I had no idea there were so many fascinating places to visit that are directly related to my research interests. I'm particularly excited about the Wellcome Collection in London and the Pasteur Institute in Paris. I will definitely make sure to visit those museums and take the tours you recommended.

I really appreciate you connecting me with your colleagues in Paris and Berlin. I'll reach out to them and see if they have any specific recommendations or insights to share. It's so generous of you to make those introductions.

I promise to take lots of pictures and notes during my trip so I can share all the fascinating things I learn with you when I return. And of course, I'll bring back some delicious European chocolates for our next dinner!

Thank you again for all your help and support. I'm so grateful for your friendship and expertise.

Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I had a wonderful time discussing Faulkner's use of symbolism with you as well. Collaborating on a paper sounds like a fantastic idea. I believe that combining our knowledge on the subject will result in a comprehensive and insightful piece.

I've been focusing on the Yoknapatawpha novels and how the symbolism employed contributes to the overall themes of the stories. I think it would be fascinating to explore how these symbols relate to the archetypal imagery you've been studying.

Let's set up a time to discuss our ideas further and outline the structure of the paper. I'm excited to work together on this project!

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, we've been asked to present our work on integrating coding into our classrooms at the upcoming staff meeting. I think this is a great opportunity to share our experiences and encourage others to give it a try.

I was thinking we could put together a short presentation showcasing some of the activities we've done with our students and the impact we've seen. We could also provide some resources for teachers who might be interested in getting started.

What do you think? Do you have any specific examples or ideas you'd like to include? I'd be happy to take the lead on putting the presentation together, but I'd love your input and feedback.

Let me know when you're available to chat more about this. I'm free most afternoons next week.

Hi Alex,

I hope this email finds you well! It's been a while since we worked together on the ""Nature for All"" project, and I've been thinking about how much impact we made on those children. I believe we can do more!

I have an idea for a new project that combines our expertise in special education and bird conservation. What if we create a series of educational materials specifically focused on migratory waterbirds, designed for children with special needs? We could develop interactive lessons, sensory-rich activities, and engaging stories that cater to different learning styles.

I think this project could not only inspire a love for nature and conservation in these children but also provide valuable resources for educators and parents. 

What do you think? Are you interested in collaborating once again? I'd love to discuss this further and hear your thoughts.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Alex,

Thank you so much for your response and for your willingness to collaborate on this project! I absolutely love the idea of having students create maps showcasing the key events and battles of the war. It's such a great way to help them visualize the geographic scope of the conflict.

I think it would be fantastic to have our students work together on this mapping project. We could have them collaborate in small groups, with each group focusing on a different region or theater of the war. They could research the key events and battles in their assigned region and create a detailed map that showcases their findings.

I'm so excited about this cross-curricular project and the opportunity for our students to learn from each other. Let's definitely set up a time to discuss this further and start planning the details.

Thank you again for your suggestions and your willingness to collaborate. I can't wait to get started on this!

Subject: Collaborating on a Cost-Benefit Analysis Textbook

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been considering writing a textbook on cost-benefit analysis and believe that your expertise in cost concepts would be invaluable to the project. I was wondering if you would be interested in collaborating with me on this endeavor?

I think our combined knowledge and experience could result in a comprehensive and engaging resource for economics students. If you're open to the idea, we could discuss the structure, content, and our respective roles in more detail.

As you may know, we'll both be attending the upcoming economics conference in Seattle. I was thinking we could meet in person there to further explore this opportunity and outline our collaboration. 

On a personal note, I'm an avid cyclist and have been looking forward to exploring some of the bike routes near the conference venue. If you're interested, perhaps we could join forces and go for a ride together?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the textbook idea and the potential for our collaboration. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Hi Emily,

Your proposed structure for the presentation looks great! I agree that dividing the sections based on our respective expertise is an excellent approach. I'll start working on the methodology and data collection section and will share my draft with you for feedback.

As for visual aids, I think it would be impactful to include some graphs and charts showcasing our key findings. We could also incorporate a short video clip of students engaging in the coding activities to help the audience visualize the learning process. I can work on creating these visual elements and send them your way for review.

I'll go ahead and book my flights and accommodation at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, so we'll be in the same location. It will be great to have those two days to practice and refine our presentation together.

Thank you for taking the lead on organizing this, Emily. I'm confident that our presentation will be well-received and will spark some great discussions among the conference attendees.

I'll be in touch soon with updates on the visual aids and the presentation content.

Hi Emily,

It was wonderful to meet you at the conference last week and discover our shared interest in the Pilgrims and the Mayflower voyage. I really enjoyed our conversation and would love to continue it over coffee sometime. I'm based in Boston now, but I'm originally from the UK, so I'm always eager to meet fellow history buffs!

Let me know if you're free to meet up sometime in the next couple of weeks. I'd be curious to hear more about your research on the social and political impact of the Pilgrims' journey, and I can share some of my findings on their theological motivations.

identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement.  

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning.   I look forward to resolution of these perspectives.

Michael,

Thank you so much for your positive response! I'm thrilled to have you on board for this project. I'll provide you with more details to help you evaluate how you can best contribute.

Project timeline:
- We aim to start production in mid-June and release the first set of videos in September.
- The series will consist of 12 videos, with each video being 5-7 minutes long.
- We'll need your input on script development, content review, and consultation during the production phase.

Target audience:
- The videos will target a general adult audience, with a focus on those who are interested in improving their health literacy and making informed decisions about their well-being.
- We aim to make the content accessible to people with varying levels of health knowledge, so your expertise in simplifying complex information is crucial.

Specific topics for your focus:
- ""The Importance of Preventive Care and Screenings""
- ""Understanding and Managing Stress""
- ""Maintaining a Healthy Diet: Debunking Myths and Misconceptions""
- ""The Role of Exercise in Physical and Mental Well-being""

Please let me know your thoughts on these topics and the overall project. I'm open to any suggestions or ideas you may have to make this series as impactful as possible.

Wednesday at 4:30pm works perfectly! I'll send you a calendar invite to confirm. Please have Lila bring some writing samples if she has any - this will help me get a sense of her current level and what we need to focus on.

It's so nice of you to ask about the half marathon! I ended up running it last fall and managed to beat my goal time, which felt great. It was a lot of training but worth it. I'm thinking of doing a full marathon this year, but still on the fence.

I hope you and Lila have been well! I know the teenage years can be a wild ride. I'm looking forward to meeting her and hearing all about her paleontology aspirations.

I just got this email from Dr. Simmons - she's had a family emergency and won't be able to give her keynote after all. This is a big blow to the program, especially given her expertise on coastal communities and climate change. Any thoughts on who we could approach as a replacement on such short notice? I'm thinking we should try to find someone who can speak to the human impacts of rising sea levels, to keep with our theme.

Also, I heard back from the city council about our request for a permit for the field trip to the coastal restoration site. They're supportive but want us to provide more details on our safety plan, given the recent storms. I can draft something up, but let me know if you have any specific ideas.

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on community engagement challenges in CLTS project

Dear Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I remember our engaging conversations at the Global Health Conference and am glad to see that you're making progress on your CLTS project in Cambodia.

Regarding the community engagement challenges you're facing, I can certainly empathize. Mobilizing communities to take collective action is often one of the most difficult aspects of implementing CLTS projects. Based on my experience, a few strategies that have proven effective include:

1. Identifying and engaging local champions who can help spearhead the initiative and inspire their neighbors to take action.
2. Conducting participatory workshops that allow community members to actively discuss the issue of open defecation and its health implications, rather than simply delivering lectures.
3. Providing small, tangible incentives for households that build and use latrines, such as seeds or tools, to encourage early adopters and create a sense of momentum.

I recently returned from a field visit to a CLTS project in Laos, which employed many of these strategies with great success. I can put you in touch with the local NGO that led the project if you're interested in learning more about their approach.

As for potential partners in Southeast Asia, I can connect you with a few colleagues at UNICEF's regional office who have extensive networks in Cambodia. They may be able to introduce you to local organizations working on WASH issues that could support your project.

Please keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or ideas to discuss. I'm always eager to collaborate with passionate WASH advocates like yourself.

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the update on the program. It's great to hear that we got the grant funding! That's a huge accomplishment, and it's a testament to all the hard work we've put into this project.

I totally understand the challenges you're facing with scheduling and volunteers. These are issues we'll need to tackle head-on if we want our program to succeed.

For the scheduling conflicts, what if we propose a rotating schedule? We could have the program take place at different times on different days, so that it doesn't always fall during the same class period or after school. That way, we might be able to accommodate more students and not conflict with other activities.

As for the volunteers, I have a few ideas. First, we could reach out to local colleges and universities with physical education or special education programs. They might have students who are interested in gaining experience working with adaptive sports. We could also try contacting local sports clubs or recreation centers to see if they have any volunteers who would be willing to help out.

I think it's important that we have a clear idea of what we're asking volunteers to do and what kind of training or experience they need. We should create a volunteer job description and application form to help us find the right people.

I'd love to brainstorm more ideas with you and figure out a game plan for tackling these challenges. Let me know when you're free to chat, and we can set up a call or video conference.

Looking forward to continuing this work with you,

him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with 
us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please 
address this with him?

Phillip
Good Morning! I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family and safe travels.

As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.

Cheers
Kirk

Subject:	SMEs for expert stories


Hello Kirk --

Hope you are doing well!

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of
producint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be
obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you
for your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:

Number of SMEs needed:  10
Number of expert stories: 20-25
Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a
mix of structurers, originators and traders


I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will
follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main
difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of
11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with
them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at
least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.

(11/26-11/28)
                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs
(11/28-11/30)
                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding
the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to
discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.
(12/3-12/6)
               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we
need and where they can provide stories.
                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the
stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video
shoot.
                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.
                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to
SMEs
(12/10-12/12)
                          --Video shoot

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ann

Dear Dr. Smith,

Thank you for your email and for suggesting this collaboration. I am very excited about the prospect of working together on such an intriguing project. Your expertise on the religious aspects of the Pilgrims' settlement will undoubtedly enrich my research on the political implications of their journey and its impact on colonial America.

I agree that our work would complement each other well, and I would be delighted to discuss the structure and content of our joint research in more detail. Perhaps we could schedule a video call to brainstorm ideas and outline our approach?

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out and for thinking of me for this exciting project. I would be delighted to collaborate with you on developing this new middle school history curriculum. Your passion for using technology to engage students in learning about history is truly inspiring, and I believe that my expertise in ancient European history could be a valuable asset to the project.

I have been doing some research on the interactions between the Celts, Romans, Saxons, and Vikings, and I recently uncovered some fascinating new evidence that challenges some of the commonly held beliefs about these groups. I would be happy to share this information with you and explore how we could incorporate it into the curriculum to make it more engaging and accurate.

I am particularly interested in developing interactive, technology-based learning modules that bring the past to life for students. For example, we could create a virtual reality simulation that allows students to experience what it was like to be a Celt living under Roman rule, or a Viking trader navigating the complex trade networks of the time.

I would love to set up a time to chat more about this project and brainstorm some additional ideas. Please let me know your availability in the coming weeks.

Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSS
Meeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstorming
Date: 12/1/00

Anthony Gilmore
Global Strategic Sourcing Attendee: 
Jeff Youngflesh

Bristol Babcock
Kevin Finnan
Jim Griffeth

Pagosa Energy/Well Master
Rob Bender


DISCUSSION POINTS:

1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with 
placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, 
corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data 
transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of 
interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy 
""unified solutions"" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  
this could take a longer term to reach the necessary ""critical status"", due 
to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow 
generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.
1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales 
of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network 
capacity.  (a ""sell-through"" effect for EBS)

2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions 
to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that 
a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could 
accelerate to the necessary ""critical status"", bringing to EBS more solutions 
demand due to the addition of ""sell-to"".  The ""sell-through"" effect would be 
present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a 
sales ""channel""), as well as EBS ""sell-to"" BBI & Pagosa for their own 
internal consumption of bandwidth.
____________________________________________________________________


ACTION ITEMS:  
1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services 
the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's 
(Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.

2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would 
be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to 
execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas 
well-head).

3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, 
attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) 
at Bristol and/or Pagosa.
3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at 
Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from 
well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.

Dear Jeff:

It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith and
Kevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had an
opportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site and
look at aspects of the ""demo"" section.  This is a very dynamic program
with changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time to
meet the individual needs of our customers.

There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means of
communication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure not
only for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet in
its infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest from
numerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enron
to help us on the road to becoming the ""Microsoft"" of oil and gas well
automation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep a
dialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our two
companies where such an alliance would make sense.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rob Bender,
President - PagosaEnergy.com

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and congratulate you on your recent publication in the Journal of Virology. I read your paper on the novel animal model for HIV and found it to be a fascinating and important contribution to the field.

I was particularly impressed by your team's approach to modeling the early stages of HIV infection and the insights you gained into the immune response. Your findings could have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

I would love to discuss your work further and explore potential collaborations between our labs. Do you have any upcoming availability for a call or virtual meeting?

Hi Alex,

That's fantastic progress on your project! I'm really looking forward to seeing what you discover about Saturn's rings. If you need any help or want to bounce ideas off someone, feel free to reach out.

Now, about the total solar eclipse, I think that's an incredible idea! I've never witnessed one before, and it would be an amazing experience to share it with a fellow astronomy enthusiast. I'm definitely in!

Let's start planning the trip. Do you have any specific locations in mind for the best viewing spots? We should also consider accommodation and transportation options. I'm happy to help with the arrangements.

Excited for this adventure!

Cheers,

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

WINDOWS XP URBAN LEGENDS AND MYTHS--DEBUNKED!

    As the clamor about Windows XP grows--it's
         being officially launched tomorrow--so
         does the confusion. I'll take a look at the
         most common misconceptions and questions
         about licensing, authorization, and compatibility
         and give you some answers.

    HOW WIN XP MARKS THE END OF THE PC'S PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE

    The debut of Windows XP could stand as
    an occasion more momentous than Microsoft
    itself anticipated. Reason: At the
    same time we're saying hello to the new
    OS, we could be saying goodbye to the
    Microsoft-Intel duopoly.

  WINDOWS XP JUST DOESN'T CUT IT IN THE SECURITY DEPARTMENT

   Like those cheesy all-in-one stereos from
         the '70s, the components in Windows XP are
         inferior to their standalone counterparts--especially
         when it comes to security. Robert points out
         the OS's security weaknesses, and tells you
         how to safeguard your computer.

Robert,

That's fantastic news! I'm so glad you're excited about the workshop idea. I'll be eagerly awaiting your project suggestions.

And please, do let me know how the projects go with your students. I'm always looking for ways to improve and refine these ideas, so any feedback you can provide will be incredibly valuable.

I'm really looking forward to collaborating with you on this. It's always a pleasure to work with someone who is as passionate about education as I am.

James,

I'm glad to hear you're looking forward to your visit. The hotel and restaurant are aware of your vegetarian preference, so you can expect some delicious plant-based Brazilian dishes.

Thank you for sharing the article on Bolsa Família. It's a program I've been following closely, and I appreciate any new insights. I'll be sure to read it thoroughly.

As for hiking, there are some beautiful spots near São Paulo. I recommend the Cantareira State Park, which offers a variety of trails with stunning views of the Atlantic Forest. If you have time, you might also consider visiting the Ibitipoca State Park, about 200 km from São Paulo, known for its waterfalls and rock formations.

Safe travels, and see you soon!

Hi,

If you sent a bank wire on Monday then it should take about 2-3 days to
be credited to your account, but sometimes it takes one or two days
longer.  So, if you don't see it today, please give us a call at 888 304
2206 and ask for either Maria or Juliette in the accounts department and
they will assist you.

Thanks,

WSEX

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility.

Subject: Re Larry May - REVISED


John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st  $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

Dear John,

It's great to hear from you! I remember our conversation at the conference and am glad to hear that your WASH project has been successful. Scaling up is an exciting next step, and I'd be happy to provide some guidance.

Based on my experience, the key to successful scaling is to have a clear strategy, robust monitoring and evaluation system, and strong partnerships. I can share some resources on these topics and also introduce you to a few colleagues who have worked on similar projects in the region.

If you can provide more details on your current project, such as the specific interventions, target population, and initial results, that would be helpful for me to give more targeted advice.

I'm also happy to schedule a call to discuss this further if that would be useful.

Looking forward to supporting your important work!

Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Julie,

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?

That would be fantastic! My students would be thrilled to hear from you and learn about your work. A Skype session would be ideal - we have a smart board set up in the classroom so you'll be able to share your screen if needed.

Tuesday afternoons work well for me. If you're available on Tuesday, April 4th at 3:15 pm, that would be perfect. We have a 45-minute period, so you could speak for about 20-25 minutes and then we can open it up for questions from the students.

Please let me know if that works for you. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this 
power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC 
in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a 
mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them 
with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a 
way to generate false P&L?

A couple of issues:

1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit 
exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, 
Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they 
blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 
minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need 
the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.

2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message 
describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the 
counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same 
error message",corporate,No

David,

I'm so glad you found the article helpful! I'd be more than happy to brainstorm some ideas for interactive activities and demos. In fact, I've been working on a few myself for my research project. One idea I've been playing around with is using a giant inflatable balloon to demonstrate the concept of quark confinement. I think it could be a really engaging way to illustrate the idea that quarks are never found in isolation.

I'm also curious to know more about how you're structuring your new curriculum. Are you focusing on any particular topics or themes?

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this!

Subject: Stargazing and Sustainable Farming Event Planning

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed, I think our interdisciplinary event ""Stargazing and Sustainable Farming: A Night of Science and Wonder"" has the potential to be really engaging and informative for the local community. 

To get the ball rolling, I've secured the university's observatory as our venue for the stargazing portion of the event. It has a great view of the night sky and plenty of space for attendees. I was thinking we could start the event with a brief presentation on the basics of astronomy and how it relates to our understanding of Earth and its place in the universe.

What do you think about having a few interactive stations set up where attendees can learn about sustainable farming practices and see some of the technologies we use in action? We could have a demo of soil moisture sensors, a virtual reality experience of a precision agriculture drone flight, and a hands-on activity where people can plant their own mini herb garden to take home.

Let me know your thoughts on this and if you have any other ideas for making the event engaging and memorable for our attendees. I'd love to brainstorm further and start promoting the event to the community.

Best,

Thad,

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:

1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served:  ""sell with"" (each other); and ""sell through"" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a ""jumping off point"" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
""EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use"" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.  

Thank you,

Jeff

I've attached a link to my recent publication on the Kashmir conflict, which I thought you might find interesting. I would also be grateful for any recommendations you have on resources related to your work on social justice issues in the American context.

Looking forward to hearing from you and potentially collaborating in the future.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

Hey Sam,

I hope you're doing well! I just came across this article about NASA's Mars 2020 mission and thought you'd find it interesting. They've released some new images from the Perseverance rover and the insights they've gained so far are incredible!

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/mars-2020-new-images

I'm particularly fascinated by the rock samples they've collected and the potential implications for understanding Mars' geological history. It makes me even more excited about our own spacecraft project and the possibilities it holds for future exploration.

What do you think about the new findings? Have you had any breakthroughs on the software side of our project lately?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Hi Jenna,

It's great to meet you and I'm so glad you reached out! Welcome to Oakwood. I'm really excited to hear about your work with our DHH students and your idea for an arts-focused program for them. I think that's a fantastic concept and could be incredibly impactful.

A few initial thoughts:
- We could potentially incorporate some visual storytelling and theater elements to help the students express themselves and build confidence. I know a great organization in the city that does really innovative work in this area with kids who are DHH.
- Music could be a powerful way to engage the students as well, even if it needs to be adapted. I've seen some cool programs that use vibrations and visual cues to teach music to DHH kids.
- It would be great to get some of the students' families involved too, to help them support their child's learning and creativity at home.

I'd be really happy to help you brainstorm further and connect you with some other educators and organizations who could be great resources. I think this program has so much potential!

Also, I'd be glad to write a letter of support for your grant proposal. Just send me over the details and let me know what you need from me.

Let me know if you want to grab coffee sometime soon to chat more. I'm happy to introduce you to some of my colleagues as well who I think would be really interested in getting involved.

Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Subject: Final touches on the grant proposal

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I've been reviewing our grant proposal and I think we've made some great progress. However, I have a few suggestions for the final revisions before we submit it.

1. In the introduction, I think we should emphasize the potential impact of our research on combating desertification more clearly. We could mention the recent droughts in the region and how our biodegradable polymers could help mitigate their effects.

2. In the methodology section, I suggest we provide more details on the specific types of polymers we plan to use and how they will be synthesized. This will give the reviewers a better understanding of the technical aspects of our project.

3. Finally, I think we should add a brief discussion on the potential scalability of our approach and how it could be applied to other regions facing similar issues.

Let me know your thoughts on these suggestions. If you agree, I can make the changes and send you the updated draft by Friday for your final review. Our deadline is next Monday, so we should have plenty of time to make any last-minute adjustments.

I appreciate your collaboration on this project. It's been a pleasure working with you.

Best regards,

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if
you can answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day
swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is
no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full
swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring
a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill

George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: RE: Great news!

Rodrigo,

Congratulations on getting our paper accepted! This is a huge accomplishment, and I'm so grateful for your hard work in finalizing the manuscript. I'm attaching a small gift to celebrate - a virtual bottle of Brazilian cachaca. Let's plan to have a virtual celebratory drink soon!

Regarding our next project, I've been thinking a lot about the current political climate in Brazil and how it relates to the historical themes we explored in our paper. One idea I had is to examine the role of social movements in shaping democratic institutions and processes in Brazil, particularly in the post-dictatorship era. There has been a resurgence of social activism in recent years, and I think it would be interesting to analyze how these movements are influencing political outcomes.

Another idea is to explore the impact of economic inequality on democratic stability in Brazil. As you know, Brazil has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, and there is a growing body of research suggesting that high levels of inequality can undermine democratic institutions. We could examine how economic disparities have shaped political participation, representation, and policy outcomes in Brazil.

Let me know what you think of these ideas, or if you have any other suggestions. I'm happy to take the lead on drafting a grant proposal for this project, but I would definitely want to collaborate closely with you on the research design and analysis.

I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership and tackling these important research questions together.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for reaching out about the presentation. I completely agree that this is a great opportunity to share our work and inspire others to incorporate coding into their classrooms.

I think your idea of showcasing some of the activities we've done and the impact we've seen is perfect. We could include some before-and-after examples of student work, as well as some quotes from students about how they've benefited from learning coding.

I'd also like to include some information about the resources and tools we've found most helpful, like the coding websites we've used and the lesson plan templates we've developed. Maybe we could even create a handout with links and tips for getting started?

As for specific examples, I've been really happy with how my students responded to the Scratch project we did last month. They were so creative and engaged, and I think it would be a great project to highlight.

Let me know what you think of these ideas. I'm happy to help with the presentation, too. How about we meet next Wednesday afternoon to work on it together?

Thank you for your suggestions on the interactive elements! I really like the idea of using PhET simulations and creating video demonstrations of key experiments. The interactive quizzes and assessments will also be a great addition to reinforce student understanding.

I'll start incorporating these elements into the modules and will send you the updated content outlines early next week for your review.

I'm so glad you enjoyed the mushroom risotto recipe! It's one of my favorites. I've been experimenting with different variations lately.

That's a great idea to bring in guest speakers! I know a few chemists who would be more than happy to talk to the students about the science behind pigments and color. And I love the idea of having local artists share their insights as well.

In fact, I was just talking to a colleague who works at the local science museum. She mentioned that they might be interested in hosting an exhibition of the students' work once the project is complete. I think that would be a great way to showcase what the students have learned and give them a real sense of accomplishment.

Let me know if you want me to reach out to the museum and see if they'd be interested in hosting the exhibition. In the meantime, let's start compiling a list of potential guest speakers and mentors.

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Hi Emily,

Thanks for sharing this information about Modeling Instruction! I had a chance to look through the resources you attached, and it sounds like a really interesting approach. I like the idea of engaging students in building mental models and helping them develop a deeper understanding of chemical concepts.

I've been thinking about ways to make my lessons more interactive and engaging as well. I recently came across a few websites that offer virtual labs and simulations for chemistry students. I think these could be a great supplement to our regular lab activities and help students visualize some of the concepts we cover in class.

Here are a couple of the websites I found:
- https://chemcollective.org/
- http://www.chemdemos.uoregon.edu/

I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on these resources and whether you think they might be useful for our students.

It would be great to find some time to chat more about both Modeling Instruction and these virtual labs. Do you have any availability next week to grab a coffee and discuss further?

when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

Subject: RE: Exciting new theropod discovery!

Olivia,

I've reviewed the data and photographs you sent over, and I must say, this is a remarkable discovery! The unique features of this fossil are truly intriguing, and I agree that it has the potential to challenge our current understanding of theropod evolution.

However, I have some reservations about classifying it as a new clade or subfamily just yet. The features you've identified, while distinct, could potentially be attributed to individual variation or sexual dimorphism within an existing clade.

I think we need to approach this with caution and consider all possible explanations before proposing a new taxonomic classification. We should also consult with other experts in the field to get their input and insights.

That being said, I'm excited to delve deeper into this research and explore the implications of your discovery. Let's schedule a call early next week to discuss our strategy and outline the key points we want to address in the paper.

I appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication to this project. It's collaborations like these that drive scientific progress and expand our knowledge of the prehistoric world.

Looking forward to our call!

Best,
Liam",research,No

Adam:
Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself - my name is Jenna Thompson and I'm the new special education teacher at Oakwood, focusing on working with our deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students. I've heard great things about the arts-integrated programming you're doing and thought I'd reach out to connect.

I'm excited to get more involved in the school community and am especially interested in exploring ways to make arts education more accessible to our DHH students. I've been thinking about potentially starting an after-school club or program specifically for them that incorporates music, theater, visual arts, etc. in ways that support their learning and social development. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this idea and if you'd be open to collaborating in some way.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to chat more about this. I'm happy to provide more details on my vision and background. Looking forward to working with you!

I've also been thinking about the NSF grant application. I think we have a strong case, given the novelty and potential impact of our research. We should start preparing the proposal as soon as possible to ensure we meet the deadline.

Emily,

Thanks for your email. I'm glad to hear that things are going well at Oakwood High. Here at Whitman, we've had a bit of a rocky start to the semester with some unexpected staffing changes, but we're starting to find our footing.

I did have a chance to review the conference proposal, and I think it looks great! You've done a fantastic job outlining our main points and supporting evidence. If it's okay with you, I'd like to add a brief section on the importance of fostering a growth mindset in chemistry students. I think it ties in nicely with our overall theme of effective teaching strategies.

As for your suggestion about including technology, I completely agree. I've been using a few different tools in my classes as well, and I think it would be valuable to share our experiences with the conference attendees. Perhaps we could each present one or two of our favorite tools and then facilitate a discussion with the audience about their own experiences and ideas.

I'm really excited about our proposal, and I think it will be a great session. I'm looking forward to fine-tuning it with you over the next few weeks.

James,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been doing some digging in the Russian State Archives and came across a previously unknown letter from Tsar Alexander II to his foreign minister, Prince Gorchakov, discussing the negotiations leading up to the Alaska Purchase. It sheds new light on the Russian motivations behind the sale and could significantly impact our argument about the geopolitical implications of the transaction.

I've attached a translation of the letter for you to review. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we might incorporate this new information into our lecture and paper. Do you think it warrants a restructuring of our argument, or can we simply integrate it into our existing framework?

During her last appointment, she expressed concerns about receiving the recommended vaccinations, citing some misinformation she found online.

Given her high-risk status and the approaching due date, I believe it's crucial that we address her concerns and ensure she receives the necessary vaccinations.

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Hi James,

I hope you're doing well. I've been thinking more about our discussion on the science journalist's story and how we could expand on it. I think there's potential for a book that explores the historical and social impact of vector-borne diseases in America, from colonial times to the present.

I envision a book that combines your expertise in 17th-century American literature and the works of Toni Morrison with my knowledge of disease prevention and control. We could structure it chronologically, with each chapter focusing on a different time period and the vector-borne diseases that were prevalent then. Your insights on how these diseases were depicted in literature and affected society would be invaluable.

What do you think? Would you be interested in co-authoring such a book? If so, we could start brainstorming potential publishers and how to divide the work between us.

Subject: RE: DNA project update

Hi Robert,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad to hear that you're making good progress on the historical aspects of our paper. You raise an excellent point about the biochemical aspects of DNA structure and how they might have influenced public perception.

As I've been researching the molecular structure of DNA, I've been struck by how the double helix model, with its complementary base pairing, seemed to naturally lend itself to the idea of genetic replication and inheritance. It's fascinating to consider how this relatively simple molecular structure has had such profound implications for our understanding of life and evolution.

I think it would be great to include a section in our paper discussing how the biochemical properties of DNA, as they were understood at the time, shaped the public's understanding of the molecule and its role in heredity. I can provide some insights on this from a biochemical perspective, and we can work together to integrate it with your historical analysis.

Let me know when you're available to discuss this further and coordinate our writing efforts.

Hey Ryan,

It was great meeting you at the engineering club meeting last week. I really enjoyed our discussion about optimizing systems and problem-solving. I've been thinking about our conversation and had an idea for a project we could work on together.

At my power plant, we're always looking for ways to improve our water treatment processes and increase efficiency. I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on a digital control system that could monitor water quality in real-time and automatically adjust treatment processes. I think your expertise in digital electronics and circuit design could be really valuable.

Let me know if you're interested, and we can set up a time to discuss the idea further.

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

The images reveal previously undiscovered volcanic features that could significantly impact our understanding of Io's geological processes.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Hey Emily,

Thanks for sharing the script! I've reviewed it and think it's well-structured and informative. One suggestion I have is to include a few more interactive elements, like asking the audience questions or encouraging them to share their thoughts on certain historical events. This could help keep them engaged throughout the presentations.

Regarding the audio-visual setup, I've managed to secure most of the equipment we need. However, I think we should consider adding a few more microphones for the Q&A session following the presentations. I'll also work on creating a slideshow with relevant images and videos to complement your script.

I hope this message finds you well. I've been thinking about our conversation at the CFR conference last year and the parallels you drew between Brazil's transition to democracy and the current moment in the U.S. I'm reaching out because I've been working on a book about the role of the judiciary in consolidating democracy here and I think your insights on race and the media in the U.S. would be really valuable as I'm framing my argument.

I'd love to hear more about your work on the Black Lives Matter protests and police reform debates. I'm also writing to extend an invitation - the University of São Paulo is hosting an international symposium on ""Law and Social Change"" next month and I think you'd be a perfect fit for one of our keynote addresses. I know it's short notice but I would be thrilled if you could join us to speak about the role of the media in shaping public discourse around race and policing in the U.S. 

Please let me know if you might be available and if there's anything I can do to support your participation. I'm happy to cover your travel and accommodation expenses, of course.

Jeff:
Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.

Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for the update on the educational technology components. I've been really impressed with the work you've been doing and I'm excited to see the latest designs.

I'd be happy to meet next week to discuss your ideas for interactive learning tools. I have a conflict on Tuesday, but Thursday morning works well for me. How about we meet at the community center site at 10am? That way we can walk through the space together and visualize the possibilities.

I've also been thinking about how we can incorporate some geospatial data visualization into the design, to help students understand the relationship between the community center and the surrounding neighborhood. I'd love to get your thoughts on that as well.

Looking forward to our meeting!

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star
Date: 01/20/01 22:15

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, 
a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting,"" McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

""I was getting worried,"" he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider 
some changes.""

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

I also had a meeting with a potential publisher last week, and they seem really interested in our project. They're especially excited about the angle we're taking, focusing on the historical context of data storage and its impact on society.

Hi Dr. Clarke,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been great corresponding with you over the past few months, and I've found your insights on physics education to be incredibly valuable.

I'm reaching out today because I'm working on a new project that I think you might be interested in. I'm developing a series of educational videos aimed at explaining particle physics concepts to a general audience. As you know, particle physics can be quite complex and intimidating for those without a strong physics background, so my goal is to create content that is engaging and accessible to viewers with varying levels of knowledge.

I was wondering if you might have any advice or suggestions for making the videos as effective as possible. I would be particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on:

1. What topics or concepts are most important to cover in an introductory particle physics series?
2. What teaching methods or strategies have you found to be most effective for engaging students and making complex ideas more accessible?
3. Are there any common misconceptions or difficulties that students tend to encounter when learning about particle physics?

I would be incredibly grateful for any insights or recommendations you might have. If you have the time and inclination, I would also love to hear about your experiences writing textbooks and teaching high school physics.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Subject: RE: Help with polarization and transmission of radiation

Hey Alex,

Thanks for reaching out! I totally understand how tricky these concepts can be. I'd be more than happy to meet up and go over the material with you. I think I've got a pretty good handle on the experimental aspects of it, so hopefully, I can help clarify some things for you.

I'm free Thursday afternoon if that works for you. We could meet at the coffee shop on campus around 3 pm? Let me know if that works, and if not, we can find another time that suits you better.

Looking forward to working through this together!

Here is a simplistic spreadsheet.  I didn't drop in the new generation yet, 
but even without the new plants it looks like Q3 is no worse than last year.
Can you take a look and get back to me with the bullish case?

thanks,

Dear  John,

First of all, congratulations. You have made headlines in Brazil.
Whenever you come to our country, let me know, so I can provide you with
assitance.

When convenient, please let me know Jeff Shenkman's(Enron Global Markets)
email, so I can get in contact.

All the best,

Cacio Carvalho


____________________________________________________

Dear Jeff,
After reading a series of reports on Enron Global Markets,  I decided to get
in contact.
I live in Brazil and had a chance to meet Jim Ballantine whom was(until
recently) heading Enron's operations in Brazil.
Currently, I work as an Strategic Planning Manager at Copergas, a Natural
Gas Distributor located in Northeast Brazil (partly owned by Enron).
Jim once mentioned that EOL intends to come to Brazil. According to the
press, Enron Global Markets will be responsable for expanding the EOL
platform worldwide.
I want you to know that my professional background includes IT, Government,
Marketing and Business Development. When Enron Global Markets decides to
expand into Brazil, let me know.  I will be more than happy to join such an
outstanding team.
My best  and a SUPER 2001,
Cacio Carvalho

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Subject: Historical Society Website Update

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the progress on the historical society's website. I've been going through the content you sent me last week, and I think it looks great! The images of the burial sites are really striking, and I think they'll be a great addition to the exhibit.

I did have a couple of questions about the DNS configuration. I noticed that the domain name we originally chose (ancientburialsofsometown.org) is already taken. Do you have any suggestions for alternative domain names? I was thinking something along the lines of ""sometownancientburials.org"" or ""sometownneolithicburials.com"". Let me know what you think.

Also, I wanted to thank you again for all the hard work you've put into this project. Your expertise has been invaluable, and I really appreciate your dedication to making this exhibit a success.

Best regards,

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out! I really appreciate your kind words about my research. I'm excited about the potential for collaboration between our fields as well.

I would be very interested in exploring the use of satellite imagery to identify fossil sites. That's a fascinating idea that I haven't considered before. If you could put me in touch with your contacts at NASA, I would be happy to discuss this further and see if we can put together a proposal.

Your work on space debris and the long-term impacts of human activity in space is also fascinating. I think there are definitely some interesting parallels with my research on the preservation of delicate fossils and the potential impacts of our excavation and transportation methods. I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on this.

On a personal note, I was excited to hear about your love of hiking and nature photography. I share those passions as well. Have you ever been to Dinosaur National Monument? It's one of my favorite places to hike and explore.

I look forward to continuing our conversation and hopefully working together on some exciting projects.

Tom:
My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an 
extra seat on the jet to Tampa. 

My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New 
York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas 
derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we 
could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights 
would get us back in time.  

Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my 
contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now 
hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if 
your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me 
if the plane were leaving after the game.  

Please advise,

Subject: RE: Thoughts on the mysticism unit

Ariel,

Thank you for sharing these ideas. I completely agree that focusing on themes of spiritual longing, divine connection, and personal transformation could be very meaningful for our students. I think you're right that these are questions and struggles that many young adults grapple with, and that the Zohar and other mystical texts can offer powerful insights and guidance.

I was thinking about the idea of spiritual longing in particular, and how it can manifest in different ways – as a longing for connection with God, for a sense of purpose and meaning, for a deeper understanding of oneself and one's place in the world. I wonder if we could have our students reflect on their own experiences of spiritual longing, and then explore how different mystical texts and practices can help to address or transform that longing.

In terms of specific texts, I'm thinking about some of the Zohar's teachings on the soul and its divine origins, as well as some of the Hasidic stories and teachings about the power of prayer and devekut (cleaving to God). I also think it could be powerful to incorporate some contemplative practices, like meditation or chanting, to give students a direct experience of some of these mystical ideas.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and to keep brainstorming ways to make this unit as engaging and transformative as possible. I'm really excited about the potential of this curriculum to help our students connect more deeply with their Jewish identities and spiritual lives.

Best,

Liam,

Thank you so much for your detailed explanation of ""quinsy."" It's incredible how the meaning of the term has evolved alongside our understanding of the condition.

Your insights have sparked my interest in exploring the broader topic of how medical terminology has changed over time. In fact, I'm working on an article for our dictionary publication about the history of medical terms and their linguistic roots. I think this could be an excellent opportunity to showcase the connection between language and medical knowledge.

I was wondering if you would be interested in collaborating on this article. With your expertise in medicine and my focus on etymology, I believe we could create a comprehensive and engaging piece that highlights the fascinating history of medical language.

Please let me know your thoughts. I would be thrilled to work with you on this project.

It's great to hear from you! I'd be more than happy to help out with the website for your ""Stargazing for Beginners"" event. As you know, I'm always eager to support science education initiatives, and this sounds like a fantastic opportunity to get the community involved in astronomy.

Could you let me know the estimated number of attendees, any specific features you need for registration, and the desired launch date for the site? Once I have that information, I can begin setting up the domain and DNS configuration.

Thanks for sharing this! GraphMaster sounds like an excellent tool, and I'm always looking for ways to incorporate more technology into my lessons. I'd definitely be interested in exploring how we can use it to enhance our students' learning experience.

Interestingly, I've been working on a new lesson plan that incorporates data visualization techniques using a free online tool called Tableau Public. I think it could be a great complement to the graphing software you discovered. I'd love to share the lesson plan with you and get your feedback on how to make it even better.

Let's definitely grab lunch next week to discuss both GraphMaster and my Tableau Public lesson plan. How about Tuesday in the teacher's lounge?

Hi Alex,

I'm so glad you found my email helpful. I completely understand how you feel - I had a similar experience when I was learning chemistry and struggled with these concepts at first. Luckily, I had a teacher who went above and beyond to help me understand the material, and that inspired me to become a teacher myself and do the same for my students.

I've attached the link to the online resource I mentioned. Feel free to explore it on your own, and let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to set up a time for us to go over it together, either in person or via a video call, whichever works best for you.

Remember, everyone learns differently, so don't get discouraged if it takes you a little longer to grasp these concepts. With some extra time and practice, I'm confident you'll get there.

Hey Alex,

Great to hear from you! I'm flattered that you thought of me for this. I'd be happy to help out however I can.

Gene editing is such a fascinating and rapidly evolving field - it's been a while since I've written about it, but I'm sure I can rustle up some thoughts. Off the top of my head, I think it's crucial to emphasize the potential benefits (e.g. treating genetic diseases, improving crops) while also acknowledging the very real risks and unknowns (unintended consequences, ""designer babies,"" etc.).

I think our role as science journalists is to provide a balanced, nuanced perspective and to help our readers understand the complexities of these issues. We need to go beyond the hype and really dig into the science, while also considering the broader societal implications.

I'm pretty swamped with deadlines next week, but I'd love to grab that coffee/breakfast and chat more in person. Let me know when you're free and we'll make it happen.

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the update! It's great to hear that you're making headway with the video game console project. It sounds like a fascinating case study for our paper.

On my end, I've been able to make some progress with the military computer hard drive. The low-level formatting was indeed tricky, but I managed to find a workaround by using a custom-built interface to read the data directly from the platters. It's slow going, but I'm confident we'll be able to recover most, if not all, of the data.

I agree that our paper will highlight the critical nature of our work. Let's plan to have a call next week to go over our respective sections and ensure we have a cohesive narrative.

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?

Subject: RE: Additional tutoring session and study tips

Hi Alex,

Saturday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's meet at the usual spot at 2 pm. I'll come prepared with some additional resources and practice questions for the topics you'd like to review.

I'm glad to hear that mind mapping has been helpful for you! It's a fantastic technique that I often recommend to my students. It's great that you've found a strategy that works well for you and helps you see the connections between different concepts.

Remember, consistency is key when it comes to studying. Even if you can only dedicate a short amount of time each day, making it a regular habit can make a big difference in retaining information.

If you have any specific questions or concerns before our session on Saturday, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

Take care and keep up the great work!

Best,

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.   ",corporate,No

Dear Alexei,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been making some progress on my paper about the Alaska Purchase and the broader context of Russo-American relations in the 19th century. I was wondering if you might be willing to take a look at the draft and share your thoughts? I know you've done extensive research on Russian expansionism during this period, and I would greatly value your insights.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how the Alaska Purchase fits into the larger pattern of Russian imperial ambitions and the shifting balance of power in the Pacific Northwest. I think your work on the Russian-American Company and the colonization of Alaska could really help shed light on this.

Please let me know if you'd be willing to take a look at the draft. I'm happy to reciprocate by reviewing any of your work in progress as well.

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out and introducing yourself. I am familiar with your work in elementary art education and commend your efforts to enrich young minds through cultural and musical experiences.

I am intrigued by the ""Art of War"" exhibit concept and would be honored to collaborate with you on this project. The interplay between art, propaganda, and the logistical systems that support their creation and dissemination is a fascinating topic that deserves exploration.

I am particularly interested in discussing how the distribution networks for wartime art and propaganda may have influenced their content and style. Additionally, I believe examining the role of cultural and musical propaganda in shaping morale both on the home front and among troops could provide valuable insights into the psychological aspects of warfare.

Please let me know when would be a good time for us to have a more in-depth discussion about our potential collaboration. I look forward to working with you on this exciting exhibit.

a couple of observations from here:
cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

STRUCTURE:

liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know. ",corporate,No

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards

Remember we were trying to figure out the difference in return between tax 
free investment growth and annually-taxed investment growth?  Turns out that 
it is different, but over 5 years and a 10% growth rate, it doesn't amount to 
much more than the cost of our beer tab.  See attached.

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled to hear about your interest in collaborating for the Greensboro Environmental Alliance event. It's wonderful to see educators like you working to engage students in environmental issues and real-world applications of mathematics.

I would be more than happy to discuss how we can work together to make this event a success. I think it's a great idea to incorporate some of my research into your lesson plans, and I'm open to any suggestions you have for making the presentations engaging and interactive.

One idea I had was to have the students participate in a mini-workshop where they analyze some of the data we've collected on local wildlife populations and create visualizations to communicate their findings. This could be a great way to showcase their mathematical skills and spark their interest in environmental conservation.

I'm also happy to provide you with any resources or information you need to incorporate conservation genetics and wildlife immunology into your curriculum.

Please let me know your thoughts on these ideas, and feel free to suggest any other ways we can collaborate. I'm looking forward to working with you and your students!

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: Econometrics and Linguistics Collaboration

Emily,

Thanks for your email. Your ideas about the dataset and statistical methods are very helpful. I agree that finding a suitable corpus with economic data from the same regions and time periods will be crucial for our analysis.

Regarding the statistical methods, mixed-effects models sound like a good choice, especially since they can handle both fixed and random effects. We could also consider using Bayesian methods, which might allow us to incorporate prior knowledge about the relationships between economic and linguistic variables.

I have a few ideas for potential corpora we could use, such as historical newspapers or government documents. I'll do some more research on this and send you a list of options.

One other thing I wanted to mention is that we should think about how to present our findings to both econometricians and linguists. We'll need to make sure our paper is accessible to readers from both fields, which might mean explaining some of the more technical aspects of our analysis in a clear and concise way.

Looking forward to continuing our collaboration!

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and share some exciting news with you. As you may know, I recently received a grant to study the synthesis of complex carbohydrates involved in cell signaling. The project is expected to yield significant findings and has the potential to open up new avenues for targeted drug delivery.

Hi Samantha,

Thanks for reaching out! I really enjoyed our conversation at the conference as well, and I'm excited about the potential for collaboration. Your idea of creating a pilot program that combines educational modules with Arduino-based learning kits is fascinating, and I think it aligns well with my vision for using blockchain technology to create more open and accessible learning opportunities.

I've been doing some research into the technical requirements for creating a blockchain-based platform for sharing educational resources, and I think we could leverage some existing tools and frameworks to get started. In terms of the learning kits, I have some experience with Arduino and other open-source hardware platforms, so I'd be happy to take the lead on designing and prototyping the kits.

I think the next step would be to put together a more detailed proposal for the pilot program, including a timeline, budget, and key milestones. We should also start thinking about potential funding sources and partnerships. I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss this further and start brainstorming next steps.

Looking forward to working together on this!

Subject: Re: Request for expertise

Dear Amelia,

Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about my lecture. I'm flattered that you would consider my insights valuable for your project, and I would be happy to assist in any way I can.

I'm particularly intrigued by the idea of creating a dictionary of scientific terms that accurately captures the nuances and complexities of these concepts. As someone who has struggled to communicate my own work to a broader audience, I recognize the importance of clear and precise language in science.

I would be glad to provide definitions and explanations for the physics terms you are working on. Please send me a list of the concepts you need help with, and I'll do my best to break them down in a way that is both accurate and accessible.

Also, I wanted to mention that I'm planning to give a public lecture on gravitational expansion in a few months. If you have any tips on how to make my ideas more engaging and understandable for a non-expert audience, I would greatly appreciate your input.

Thank you again for reaching out, and I look forward to working with you on this project.

Subject: Collaborating on a new course

Dear Nisha,

I hope this email finds you well. It was great to meet you at the interdisciplinary conference last month. I've been thinking about our conversation and I believe your expertise in constitutional law could be invaluable for a new course I'm developing on the legal and political systems of Sweden.

The course will explore the historical development of the Swedish Constitution, the structure of the Swedish government, and the role of law in Swedish society. I would greatly appreciate your input on the key aspects of constitutional law that should be covered, as well as any suggestions you might have on how to incorporate comparative perspectives.

I would also like to invite you to be a guest lecturer for a session on Indian constitutional law and its cultural context. I think our students would benefit immensely from hearing about your work and the insights you can provide on the Indian legal system.

Please let me know if you would be interested in collaborating on this course and if you have any availability to discuss it further.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Seeking your expertise on Roman water management systems

Dear Akiko,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad to know that my expertise could be of help in your exhibition project. The topic of the influence of Roman water management systems on Asian garden designs is indeed fascinating and not widely explored.

From my research, I can tell you that the Romans were highly skilled in hydraulic engineering, and their techniques for moving and controlling water were unparalleled at the time. They built aqueducts, fountains, and even intricate plumbing systems that allowed for the precise control of water flow.

It's entirely possible that these techniques were adopted and adapted in other cultures, including in the garden designs of China, Korea, and Japan. I've seen some evidence of similar water control features in Asian gardens, such as the use of channels and water wheels to circulate water.

I'd be happy to delve deeper into this topic and provide you with more detailed information and resources. I'll also look through my archives for any relevant papers or articles that could be useful for your research.

I'd love to see the photos you took of the Roman aqueducts in Italy. It would be interesting to compare them to the water features in the Japanese gardens you're studying.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help with your exhibition. I'm excited to see the results of your work!

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Phillip

Hey Jordan,

I hope you're doing well! I know it's been a while since we've chatted, but I could really use your help on a new series I'm working on about gene editing technologies (CRISPR, etc.). I remember you did some great pieces on this topic last year, and I'd love to get your thoughts on the current state of the field, potential risks and benefits, and any other insights you might have.

I'm particularly interested in exploring the ethical and societal implications of these technologies. How do you think we, as science journalists, can best communicate these complex issues to our readers? I'd really appreciate any input or suggestions you might have.

Let me know if you have time for a quick call sometime next week to discuss further. I'm happy to buy you a coffee (or a beer!) if you're up for meeting in person.

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.

George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

I completely agree this could be the seed of an important new project. Being able to tie together data from different volcanic arcs like the Cascades and Iceland could really elevate the modeling work we want to do. 

I'm definitely in for collaborating on a grant proposal. If we can get the right funding, I think we could put together a dream team to really advance the science on this.

I'll start sketching out some ideas for the proposal and will send you my thoughts early next week. In the meantime, let's set up a call for later in the week to discuss further.

Looking forward to diving into this more with you! I'll be in touch soon.

All the best,
Jamie",research,No

Bob,

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the exciting news that our book, ""The Science of Sleep: Understanding the Mysteries of Rest,"" is finally complete and ready for publication. It's been a long journey, but I'm so proud of the work we've done together.

I've attached the final manuscript for your review. Please let me know if you have any last-minute suggestions or changes. Otherwise, I'll send it off to the publisher next week.

I'm also thinking about how we can promote the book and get it into the hands of as many readers as possible. Do you have any ideas for marketing or events we could organize? I'm open to suggestions!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and celebrating this milestone with you.

Best,

Phillip,

I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both
the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment.
Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure
that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described
below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (512)
370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000.  Thanks.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for sending over the trip overview. I had a chance to review it, and it looks like an incredible opportunity for your students. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the partnership with the local organization and how you went about selecting the projects and activities for the trip.

I've also been thinking about how we could structure a similar trip for our students and what kinds of projects might be most impactful and meaningful for them. I'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you on our call.

I'm looking forward to our conversation on Wednesday at 2 pm EST. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any other questions or thoughts you'd like to share.

Thanks for sending over the updated draft. I'm impressed with the new section on the Russian-American Company – it really adds depth to our understanding of the economic factors at play.

I made a few minor edits and added some additional sources I came across. I think we're almost ready to move on to the next chapter. What do you think about tackling the aftermath of the purchase and its impact on both countries next?

See attached.   In September 2000, Requisite filed for a $92 M IPO.  
Requisite hosts content for some customers in Denver, but the majority of its 
revenues are from licenses and contracts with SAP.  Based on negative net 
income for the past few years, I am sure that credit would take a big margin 
for these guys.  I was not able to find anything that mentioned who 
Requisite's network provider is.  

Please let me know if you would like more info.

I have spoken with Mark who is part of the GSS organization and we are going 
to pursue this after the first of the year.  Mark has a relationship with the 
President of Requisite and we will be having a meeting with him to discuss 
opportunity.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

Subject: RE: Hurricane Omar Update

John,

I agree with your assessment of the radar data. The storm is definitely intensifying more quickly than we anticipated. We need to act fast to update our forecast and get the word out to the public.

I suggest we hold a joint press conference with the National Hurricane Center to discuss the updated forecast and the potential impacts of the storm. We should also reach out to our colleagues at the local weather offices to make sure they have the latest information and are prepared to issue warnings for their areas.

Let me know what time works best for you to meet and finalize our plan.

Hi Alex,

I'm thrilled that you're interested in incorporating my research into your teaching! I would be more than happy for you to use my data in your lessons, and I'm glad you'll be properly citing my work. I think it's so important for students to understand the real-world applications of scientific research.

I'd be happy to provide guidance on how to present the information in an engaging way for your students. We could set up a call to discuss the specific data you're interested in using and brainstorm some ideas for lessons or activities.

I also love the idea of having your students participate in a virtual paleontology project. I think it could be a great way for them to gain hands-on experience with the scientific process and see how paleontological data is collected and analyzed. We could have them work with real fossil data and guide them through the process of interpreting it.

Let me know what you think about all of this, and we can start planning our next steps!

Best,

Hi Sarah,

The script sounds great! I'm excited to see how you've structured the lesson and presented Jabir ibn Hayyan's life and work. Including the historical context of the Islamic Golden Age is a fantastic idea. It will give students a more holistic understanding of the time period and its impact on scientific progress.

As for platforms, I've had good experiences using Canvas and Google Classroom for hosting educational content. They both offer a range of features for creating interactive lessons and tracking student progress. Let me know if you have any other preferences, and I can look into them.

I'll start working on the visual elements for the lesson, such as illustrations and animations to help explain complex concepts. I'll keep you updated on my progress.

Thanks for your collaboration on this project. I'm confident that we'll create something truly valuable for students and educators!

Jacques,

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

Erik,

I hope you're doing well. As we approach the start of the new semester, I wanted to touch base with you regarding our Swedish language course. I've been reviewing the course materials and syllabus, and I think we've put together a solid foundation for our students to learn and grow.

I was wondering if you could take a look at the attached assessment rubrics and provide your feedback. I'd like to ensure that we're aligning our expectations and grading criteria with the course learning objectives. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes you'd like to make.

Also, I wanted to confirm our plans for the first day of class. Are you still comfortable with the proposed icebreaker activity and course introduction? I think it's a great way to engage the students right from the start and set the tone for the semester.

Looking forward to your thoughts and to a successful launch of our Swedish language course!

Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been digging deeper into the Proto-Germanic roots of some Old English words and stumbled upon a fascinating connection between the words ""hēafod"" (head) and ""hæft"" (haft). It seems that both words share a common ancestor in Proto-Germanic, which suggests a link between the concepts of ""head"" and ""handle.""

I found an article on the subject that I thought you might find interesting: [link to article]

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm excited to work on this project with you. Creating a calming and peaceful environment is crucial for the well-being of expectant mothers, and I'm glad you recognize the importance of acoustics in achieving that goal.

Based on the information you provided, I have a few initial recommendations:

1. Sound-absorbing materials: Incorporating sound-absorbing materials such as acoustic panels, bass traps, and carpeting can help reduce echo and reverberation, creating a more peaceful environment.

2. Background noise control: Implementing a sound masking system can help minimize the impact of external noises and create a consistent, soothing background sound.

3. Soundproofing: Ensuring proper soundproofing, especially in the walls and windows, can help prevent outside noises from entering the clinic.

I would love to schedule an in-person meeting to assess the space and provide a more detailed proposal. How about next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon? Please let me know which day works best for you.

Looking forward to working together on this project!

Dear Dr. Johnson,

Thank you so much for your prompt response and for agreeing to share resources with us. My students and I are eager to dive into the materials you'll be sending our way. We're particularly interested in learning more about the genetic factors that contribute to disease susceptibility and resistance in different populations.

The project idea you mentioned sounds perfect! My students would be thrilled to work with real data and create visualizations to help communicate your findings. I think this experience will give them a deeper understanding of the practical applications of genetics and the importance of scientific research in addressing global health challenges.

As for the guest lecture, we would be honored to have you speak to our class. I think a webinar format would work best, given the current circumstances. If you're available, I was thinking we could schedule it for the week of May 10th, during our regular class time (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM CST). Please let me know if that works with your schedule.

Lastly, I wanted to mention that our school is planning a virtual science fair in June, and I think your work would be a perfect fit for our theme of ""Genetics and Global Health."" If you're interested, I would be happy to put you in touch with the organizing committee to discuss the possibility of having you as our keynote speaker.

Thank you again for your willingness to collaborate with us. I'm looking forward to working with you and introducing my students to the exciting world of research and scientific discovery.

Jim,

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

Phillip,

Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to
check out the Heritage Building.

I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come
back on the market...it's in Killeen, and was under contract for about
30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had
designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so
today he released this one.

The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best we
have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend
of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn
down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.

I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can
supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know
soon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills

Hi David,

I love your ideas for the chemistry component! Focusing on the periodic table, chemical bonding, and basic chemical reactions is perfect for this age group and will give them a solid foundation for understanding more advanced concepts in the future. The idea of having them build elements and simulate reactions in Minecraft is brilliant – it's engaging, interactive, and really drives home the concepts in a way that's fun and memorable.

In terms of learning objectives and outcomes, I think we should aim for the students to:
1. Gain a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and variables.
2. Understand the structure of the periodic table and be able to identify key elements and their properties.
3. Grasp the basics of chemical bonding and how different elements interact to form compounds.
4. Apply their programming skills to create a game or simulation that demonstrates a chemistry concept they've learned.

I think if we can achieve these objectives, we'll have done a great job of introducing these subjects to the students and inspiring them to explore further.

What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions or modifications you might have. I'm also happy to take the lead on the programming component if you'd like to focus on the chemistry side of things.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Subject: RE: Need advice on teaching ball control skills

Hi Mike,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad the resources I shared have been helpful. 

I completely understand the struggle of having players who are struggling with fundamental technical skills. It can be really frustrating, especially when it's impacting the team's performance. 

Based on my research, one thing that can be effective is providing a lot of augmented feedback, especially in the early stages of learning a new skill. This means giving specific, skill-related feedback very frequently during practice. So for dribbling, you might provide feedback on things like the angle of their foot, the pace they're dribbling at, their body positioning, where they're looking, etc. Research has shown that this type of frequent, specific feedback can really accelerate learning.

Another thing to consider is the structure of your practices. Block practice, where players repeat the same skill over and over, is often less effective than random or variable practice, where they're switching between different but related skills. So for example, instead of having them just dribble in straight lines for 20 minutes, you might have them dribble in different patterns, pass the ball to each other, do 1v1 drills, etc. The cognitive demand of switching between tasks can actually help with learning.

I've attached a couple articles that go into more detail on these concepts that you might find useful.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to support you. And keep me posted on how it goes with your team!

Emily,

Wednesday afternoon works great for me. Let's schedule the call for 2 PM EST. I'll send you a meeting invite with the Zoom link.

Thank you for sending the preliminary data and images. I'm reviewing them now, and I must say, this is truly remarkable. The design and construction of the fish weir suggest a level of sophistication and knowledge that challenges our current understanding of ancient Caribbean cultures.

I have a few initial ideas for further research, which I'll share with you during our call. I'm also reaching out to a colleague who specializes in ancient Caribbean pottery. She may be able to provide additional insights into the dating and cultural context of the site.

I'm thrilled to be a part of this groundbreaking project, and I'm confident that our collaboration will yield significant results.

Hi Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad you're interested in incorporating geography into your World War II unit. I think it's a fantastic idea to help students understand the scope of the war and its impact on different regions.

One idea that comes to mind is having students create maps that showcase the key events and battles of the war. They could use different colors and symbols to represent the Allied and Axis powers, as well as important geographic features like mountains, rivers, and strategic locations.

I would be more than happy to collaborate with you on this project and share my expertise in geography. We could even have our students work together on the mapping project, which could be a great opportunity for cross-curricular collaboration.

Let me know what you think, and we can set up a time to discuss this further.

Alex,

Friday at 2 PM Pacific Time works perfectly! I'll send you a Zoom link tomorrow morning.

In terms of technical challenges, one of the main issues we've been facing is creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for individuals who may not be tech-savvy. We want the virtual environments to be easily navigable and engaging for people of all skill levels. Any insights you could provide on streamlining the interface and improving accessibility would be incredibly valuable.

I'm attaching a few documents that outline our current VR setup and the tools we're using. Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

I'm so grateful for your willingness to collaborate on this, Alex. Your technical expertise combined with our artistic vision has the potential to create something truly impactful.

Looking forward to our call on Friday!

Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'd be more than happy to take a look at your research on Velociraptor feeding habits. It's an intriguing hypothesis and I'm looking forward to seeing what you've discovered.

As for the new fossil, I'm excited to share more details with you. The specimen is incredibly well-preserved and shows some unique features that I haven't seen before in other theropods from the Cretaceous period. I think it could help us better understand the diversity of this group and how they evolved over time.

Speaking of which, I'm planning a research trip to Mongolia later this year to study some newly discovered theropod fossils there. I was wondering if you might be interested in joining the expedition? It would be a great opportunity to collaborate and potentially make some groundbreaking discoveries together.

Let me know if you're up for it!

Subject: RE: Inquiry about Acadian history resources

Dear Dr. Theriot,

I couldn't agree more with your proposed structure for the blog series. It provides a logical progression through the key events and developments in Acadian history, while also highlighting their lasting impact on Louisiana's culture.

I think starting with the origins of the Acadians in the Maritime provinces is a great way to set the stage for their journey and the challenges they faced. From there, we can delve into their migration and settlement in Louisiana, exploring the factors that led to their relocation and how they adapted to their new environment.

Finally, examining the development of the Cajun identity and its connection to Acadian history will be a fascinating way to bring the series full circle and demonstrate the ongoing significance of this cultural group in our state.

As we develop each post, I will focus on creating engaging lesson plans and activities that bring the history to life for students. I will also provide suggestions for incorporating primary sources and technology tools to enhance the learning experience.

In addition to the blog series, I was wondering if you would be interested in presenting our collaborative project at the upcoming Louisiana History and Education Conference in New Orleans. It would be a great opportunity to share our work with a broader audience and potentially inspire other educators to incorporate Acadian history into their curricula.

I'm excited to get started on this project and can't wait to see what we create together!

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Hi Alex,

I'm so glad you reached out! I had a wonderful time chatting with you at the conference and have been thinking about our potential collaboration non-stop since then. An online platform is a fantastic idea, and I'd be happy to contribute content on the benefits of raw and living foods for optimal health and stress management.

I think we could also include some interactive elements, like quizzes and assessments, to help users understand their current risk factors and how they can improve their digital and physical well-being.

As for hiking, I'm always up for an adventure! I know some great trails just outside the city that would be perfect for a day trip. Let me know when you're free, and we can plan something.

Subject: Neolithic Burial Site in the Orkneys

Dear Finn,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding a fascinating Neolithic burial site I've been studying here in the Orkney Islands. As you know, the islands are rich in archaeological treasures, and this particular site has captured my attention due to its unique features and potential connection to a nearby volcanic eruption.

I was wondering if you might be willing to share your expertise in volcanology to help me better understand the geological context of the site. I believe that your insights could greatly enhance my research and provide valuable information about how the eruption may have affected the ancient population.

If you're interested in collaborating, I would be more than happy to share my findings with you and discuss the project in more detail. I'm particularly eager to learn more about the specific volcanic event that occurred in the region and how it might have influenced the burial practices of the Neolithic people.

Please let me know if you have any availability to discuss this further. I'm excited about the potential of this project and believe that our combined expertise could lead to some groundbreaking discoveries.

Best regards,
Eleanor",research,No

Hi Sam,

Thanks for your email. I'm glad to hear that you've made progress on the data analysis, and the concentration of the unknown acid seems reasonable based on our initial predictions. I'd be happy to meet up with you tomorrow afternoon to review the calculations together. How about we meet at the library at 2 pm? That should give us enough time to go over everything and make any necessary revisions.

Also, have you started working on the introduction and conclusion sections of the report? I think it would be a good idea for us to divide up the writing tasks to ensure that we can submit the report on time.

Looking forward to meeting with you tomorrow!

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS 
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities 
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  
After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin 
as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from 
Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith 
McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending 
additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business 
opportunities and issues.  

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice 
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000.   
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, 
Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   
The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  
EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Emily,

Your email brightened my day! I'm equally excited about our collaboration and the opportunity to share our knowledge with a wider audience. Your suggestion for the workshop structure sounds fantastic. Starting with the overview and then delving into specific strategies is a great way to engage the participants.

I love the idea of including interactive elements! Perhaps we could have participants work in small groups to apply a technique to a hypothetical student profile. This would allow them to practice the strategy and discuss their thoughts with their peers.

As for travel, I haven't booked my flights yet, but I'm planning to do so this week. Arriving on Thursday evening and leaving on Sunday afternoon works well for me, too. I'll probably stay at the conference hotel for convenience. Do you have any other must-see recommendations for Atlanta?

I'm attaching a few articles I thought might be relevant to our workshop. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them and if you think we should incorporate any of the information into our presentation.

I'm so glad we connected at the conference last year. It's rare to find a colleague who shares your passion and enthusiasm for special education. I can't wait to see what we create together!

Best,

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Chaz and Steve,

Here's the latest, in a nutshell.  Basically, the testing is not fully 
completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out 
on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  
However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.

In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  

Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep 
you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.

I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to 
me.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done.  The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's 
solution is a better one for us.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent 
product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.  I believe 
Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.

Regards,
Douglas

> Key Points:
> 1. Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at
> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
> end of the traditional withdrawal season.
> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
> of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.
> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the ""heat"" will remain on natural gas
> prices throughout 2001.
> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains
> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the
> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.

Subject: Challenging case and new dental implant

Dear Dr. Lee,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we met at the dental conference, and I've been meaning to reach out to you regarding a challenging case I've been working on.

I have a patient with several missing teeth, and I've been considering using the new dental implant you mentioned in your presentation. I was wondering if you could provide some insights into the suitability of this implant for my patient's specific case. I would greatly appreciate your expert opinion.

Additionally, I recently read about your latest research on tooth regeneration using stem cells. The findings are fascinating, and I'm curious to know more about the potential applications in dental prosthetics.

I'm also interested in attending the upcoming conference on advances in dental materials. Would you be interested in meeting up there to discuss the latest developments?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Alex Thompson",research,No

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?

but even without the new plants it looks like Q3 is no worse than last year.

Gary,

Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?  In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.  The dimensions of the house have not changed.  The quote given last week was over $26,000.  Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?  I need help understanding this increase.

Hey Mark,

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I'm working on a piece about the connection between climate change and the rising rates of skin cancer. I know this is a bit outside your usual beat, but given your background in earth science and environmental reporting, I thought you might have some insights or sources to share.

I'm particularly interested in how rising temperatures and more intense UV radiation are affecting skin cancer rates, and what steps people can take to protect themselves. If you have any thoughts or could point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

Also, I'd love to catch up sometime soon. It's been too long! Let me know if you're free for a virtual coffee chat.

Hi Alex,

That's great news about the grant application! I have a good feeling about it. We've put together a really strong proposal.

I love the idea of writing about our co-teaching experience for the blog. It was such a great example of how game-based learning can work in a classroom setting. Feel free to draft something up and send it my way. I'll take a look and add in some thoughts.

For other blog ideas, maybe we could do a post on how we got started with Minecraft in our classrooms in the first place? I know a lot of educators are interested in trying it but aren't sure where to begin. We could share some tips and resources for getting started.

I'll keep my fingers crossed on the grant! Talk to you soon,

I'm available for a call on Thursday at 2 pm if that works for you. We can go over the proposal one last time and discuss our plan for submitting the application.

Fingers crossed that we'll be successful in securing the funding! I'm excited to get started on this project with you.

I know you're always looking for ways to make your science lessons more engaging, so I was wondering if this could be something you could incorporate into your curriculum? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you could use this information to capture your students' imaginations.

Political Update

International

US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.",corporate,No

Jacques,

Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.  Don't they need something signed from Southern Pacific Bank?

I certainly don't plan on signing any assignment documents before the release is signed and settled.  Has their attorney contacted you with any revisions?  Is the ball in their court?

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base and see if you're still planning to attend the Global Conservation Summit in Cape Town next month. I just booked my flights and accommodations, and I'm really looking forward to it. It's been a while since we've had the chance to catch up in person!

I've been reading up on some of the speakers and sessions, and there are quite a few that I think would be particularly interesting for our work with the Pangolin project. I'd love to compare notes and see if we can come up with some new strategies for raising awareness and pushing for stronger protections.

Let me know if you have any other must-see sessions or events in mind. It would be great to coordinate our schedules and make sure we have some time to brainstorm together.

Looking forward to seeing you in Cape Town!

Jacques,

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

Dear Emily,

Thank you for sending over the platform overview. I had a chance to review the document and must say that I am impressed by the thoughtfulness and comprehensiveness of your approach to teaching digital literacy and online safety to young learners.

Based on the information provided, I have a few initial thoughts and questions to discuss during our call:

1. User Roles and Access Control: Given the various user types (students, teachers, parents) and the need for different access levels, we should consider implementing a role-based access control system within the database.

2. Data Security: As the platform deals with sensitive user information, particularly that of minors, we must prioritize data encryption, secure authentication mechanisms, and regular security audits.

3. Scalability and Performance: To accommodate the platform's growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we should design the database with scalability in mind, considering options like sharding or partitioning.

4. Progress Tracking and Analytics: To effectively track user progress and provide valuable insights, we may need to implement a separate analytics database that can handle complex queries and reporting.

I look forward to discussing these points and any other requirements or concerns you may have during our call on Tuesday.

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Dear Dr. Davis,

I hope this email finds you well. As you may recall, we met at the medical conference last year where you presented your fascinating research on the effects of microplastics on human health. I was truly intrigued by your work and have been following your progress ever since.

I am reaching out to you today because I am currently working on a series of articles about the impact of environmental factors on human health, and I believe your expertise on microplastics and pollution would be invaluable to my readers. I would be honored if you could spare some time for an interview to discuss your recent study and its implications for human health.

I understand that you will be speaking at the upcoming medical conference in Chicago next month, and I will be in attendance as well. If you are available, I would love to schedule a time to meet with you in person for the interview. Please let me know your availability and any other preferences you may have.

Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Gentlemen

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the High level design deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Subject:	Topic Framework Updates!


Hi Kirk,

Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic
Frameworks.  These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total
of one hour.

Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>>
there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer  on the deal flow,
they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone.  (2)
Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin
support and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating
on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate
because it is different for every company.  Admin support - answers the
phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office.

Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the
overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but
wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes.  (2) Industrial, Retail and
Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer

Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department
communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function
and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between
departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,
between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal
communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a
trade and reconciling position reports)

Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to
""Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines

Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under
Protecting Againist Loss.

The note for the references used was included on every topic framework -

Subject: Feedback on our curriculum draft

Dear Michael,

I hope you're doing well. I've just finished reviewing the feedback we received on our curriculum draft from our colleagues. Overall, I think the response has been quite positive, but there are a few areas where I believe we could make some improvements.

First, I think we need to spend more time in the introductory chapter explaining the importance of understanding the U.S. political system and how it impacts our daily lives. Several reviewers mentioned that this would help engage students from the beginning.

Second, I think we could benefit from including more real-world examples and case studies throughout the curriculum. This would help illustrate the concepts we're teaching and make the material more relatable to students.

Lastly, I think we should consider adding a chapter on the role of media in politics. This is a topic that is becoming increasingly important, and I think our students would benefit from a deeper understanding of how media influences the political landscape.

What do you think about these suggestions? I'm happy to take the lead on incorporating them into the next draft if you agree. Let me know if you have any other ideas or feedback.

Olivia,

I like your idea of mixing narrative storytelling with expert interviews. It could help us provide a more well-rounded perspective on each topic. We could reach out to some of the historians we've cited in our blog posts and see if they'd be interested in participating.

For the social media campaign, I think creating teaser videos and graphics is a great idea. We could also do a countdown to the launch date and share some behind-the-scenes content to build anticipation. Offering a sneak peek to our email subscribers is a fantastic way to incentivize sign-ups and create a sense of exclusivity.

I'm available for a call this Friday at 2 PM EST. Let me know if that works for you.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Now that we have the funding, I'm eager to dive into the next phase of our project. I've started brainstorming some ideas for our first set of lessons. I'm thinking we could start with a unit on simple machines, incorporating lots of hands-on activities that will be engaging for our DHH students. What do you think?

I'd love to set up a time for us to brainstorm further and start mapping out our lesson plans. Let me know your availability in the coming weeks.

Dear Dr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some exciting progress updates on our research project.

We have successfully synthesized the first batch of carbohydrate molecules and have begun testing their binding affinity to the target protein. The initial results look promising, with several compounds showing high binding affinity and specificity.

I have also been working closely with the team from Oxford to analyze the X-ray crystallography data. We have obtained some high-resolution structures of the carbohydrate-protein complexes, which will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of their interactions.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you next week to discuss these findings in more detail and plan our next steps. Please let me know your availability.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Subject: RE: Seeking guidance on a historical Jewish ritual

Avraham,

It's wonderful to hear from you! I am so pleased to learn about your studies in Jerusalem and the depth of your research into Jewish history and traditions. It sounds like you are making the most of this incredible opportunity.

Regarding the ritual of ""X,"" you raise an excellent question. The conflicting interpretations you mention are indeed a topic of debate among scholars. In my experience, the most widely accepted theory traces the origin of the ritual to the Second Temple period, based on archaeological evidence and references in ancient texts.

I would be happy to discuss this further with you and share some resources that I believe will be helpful in your research. If you are available, I suggest we schedule a video call to discuss this in more detail. Please let me know your availability, and we can find a time that works for both of us.

I am thrilled to see how far you have come in your studies, Avraham. Your dedication to learning and teaching is truly inspiring. Please keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,
Rabbi Sarah Silverstein",research,No

Hey Alex,

Thanks for your email and for offering to help with the geometric puzzle I mentioned. I've attached a diagram of the puzzle and the problem statement. I've been trying to apply some of the techniques we discussed at the last club meeting, but I keep hitting a wall. I'd love to hear your thoughts and any fresh ideas you might have!

On another note, I'm curious to hear more about your work project with the copper-based alloys. It sounds fascinating, and I'm always eager to learn about how mathematical principles can be applied in different fields. Do you have any updates or insights you're willing to share?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Subject: Re: SW Gas  

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base with you about our upcoming presentation at the National Conference on Climate Change and Public Health. As you know, this is a fantastic opportunity for us to share our work with a wider audience and potentially secure funding for our educational initiative.

I've been working on the slides for our presentation and wanted to get your input. Could you take a look at the attached file and let me know your thoughts? I think we have a strong message, but I want to make sure we're covering all the key points effectively.

Also, I was thinking about how we could make our presentation more engaging. Perhaps we could include some interactive elements, like a Q&A session or a short activity for the audience? Let me know if you have any ideas!

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c=
lient will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma=
il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=
onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=
igrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=
 web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T=
o-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl=
ient is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OW=
A) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connect=
ing to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA availab=
le from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou=
-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You=
 will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your us=
er id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=
  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

=09

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality betwee=
n the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the thin=
gs in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of t=
he functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the =
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

Subject: RE: Help with C++ FAQ list

Sarah,

Thank you so much for agreeing to help with this project. I really appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to contribute.

Your idea of listing the questions you had while learning C++ is perfect. We can start with the basics, such as syntax, data types, and control structures, and then move on to more advanced topics like pointers, memory management, and object-oriented programming concepts.

Please feel free to add any questions you think are relevant, even if they seem basic. Sometimes, it's the simple concepts that trip up students the most.

I look forward to seeing your list and working together to create a comprehensive FAQ for C++ learners.

Jacques,

Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?

Subject: RE: Collaboration on educational videos

Hi Emily,

Thanks for your email! I really like your idea of focusing on atomic structure and periodic trends for our video series. I agree that starting with an introduction to atomic structure and then moving on to electron configurations and periodic trends is a great way to organize the content.

I think alternating between us explaining the concepts is a great idea, and using simple animations and visual aids will definitely help make the content more engaging. I can take on the task of creating the animations and visual aids if you'd like.

I also think we should consider creating a companion website where we can post additional resources, such as quizzes, practice problems, and links to further reading. This will help students deepen their understanding of the concepts we cover in the videos.

Let me know what you think about this idea, and if you have any other suggestions for the video series.

Subject: Great hiking and brainstorming today!

Hi Jake,

It was wonderful to meet you at the conference and then spend some time hiking and chatting today. I really enjoyed our conversation and appreciate the insights you shared about using media in your ESL lessons. I've been thinking about how I could incorporate similar strategies into my geometry classes, and I'd love to bounce some ideas off you.

Would you be interested in meeting up for coffee or a virtual chat sometime soon to brainstorm? I'm free next Wednesday afternoon or anytime on Friday. Let me know what works for you!

I've attached a few resources I mentioned during our hike that I think you might find useful for your intermediate ESL students. Feel free to use them and let me know if you need anything else.

Looking forward to staying in touch and collaborating more in the future!

Emily,

I'm glad to hear that the strategies I shared resonated with you and that you found them valuable. I have no doubt that with your dedication and the approaches you're implementing, you'll be able to make significant progress in your project.

I've reached out to my contacts in Laos and at UNICEF's regional office, and they are more than happy to connect with you. I'll introduce you via email in the next few days so that you can take the conversation forward directly.

Collaborating with local organizations is indeed crucial, and I'm confident that the connections we make will be beneficial for your project. It's always inspiring to see passionate individuals like you making a difference on the ground.

Please do keep me posted on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further support or advice. I'm always here to help.

I look forward to hearing about the great work you'll undoubtedly accomplish in Cambodia, and I hope we can continue to exchange ideas and explore collaboration opportunities in the future.

By the way, I remember you mentioning your interest in sci-fi literature. Have you read ""The Windup Girl"" by Paolo Bacigalupi? It explores some fascinating themes related to biotechnology and sustainability.

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

Congratulations on your pregnancy! That's wonderful news. I know it can be daunting to think about balancing work and family, but you'll find a way to make it work. And remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

I've had a chance to review your lesson plans, and I think you've done a great job. I love how you've incorporated a variety of primary sources and have structured the lessons to encourage critical thinking and discussion.

I have a few suggestions for additional resources and some minor tweaks, but overall, I think this is a strong unit. I've made some comments and suggestions directly on the document and attached the updated file.

As for me, I'm hoping to take a research trip to some archives in the South this summer. It will be a lot of work, but I'm excited to dig into some new sources.

Thank you for sharing the MHM education materials! I had a chance to review them, and I must say, they are excellent. The content is well-structured, and the visuals are engaging. I particularly liked the activity sheets for the younger age group. I believe these materials will be very effective in creating awareness and promoting good MHM practices among schoolgirls.

Regarding our handwashing campaign, we've made some progress, but we're facing a few challenges. One of the main issues is the lack of reliable water supply in some areas, which makes it difficult for people to practice regular handwashing. We're working with the local government to address this issue and exploring alternative solutions like handwashing stations.

I'm excited to learn more about the results of your MHM project. Keep me posted on the progress.

saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

Andy,

 I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the 
west desk.  Are there any operational besides ICE and Dynegy?  If not, can 
you have your assistant call me with id's and passwords.

Subject: RE: Catching up and seeking your expertise

Alex,

I'm so glad our work is aligning in such interesting ways! I have a ton of observations and examples from my classroom that I think could be really valuable for your research. For instance, I've noticed that children are much more engaged when the technology incorporates elements of play and discovery, like interactive stories or virtual manipulatives.

I'd love to share these insights with you and brainstorm ways to incorporate them into your software. I'm available for a video call next Tuesday at 3 PM. Just let me know if that works for you and send me the meeting link.

Thank you so much for reaching out and for your willingness to collaborate. It means a lot to have your support and expertise as I navigate this new territory.

Hey Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I was just reminiscing about our time working together on the NetTech project. Those were some intense but rewarding times, huh?

How have you been? I'd love to hear about what you've been up to lately, both professionally and personally. Are you still at NetTech, or have you moved on to new adventures?

As for me, I've been diving deeper into network programming and exploring some new ideas. I've been thinking a lot about our discussions on creating our own startup one day. There's a particular project I've been working on that I think could have real potential.

Anyway, I don't want to bore you with all the details in this email. If you're interested in catching up and maybe brainstorming some ideas, I'd love to grab a coffee or have a video call sometime.

Let me know when you're free!

Best,

Jacques,

If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements.  Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.
I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the ""Receipt of Payment"".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.

It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.

Samantha,

I've reviewed the logs you sent, and you're right – it looks like the attackers had help from someone inside the client's organization. This complicates matters significantly, as we now have to consider the possibility of a mole within the client's ranks.

I suggest we approach this cautiously and limit the information we share with the client until we can verify their employees' trustworthiness. In the meantime, we should focus on containing the malware, identifying the extent of the damage, and gathering evidence to trace the attackers.

Let's discuss our game plan in more detail during our call at 2 PM.

Thank you so much for your helpful suggestions and generous offer to assist with the presentation. I really appreciate your willingness to support our event and help inspire my students.

I love your idea of giving a short presentation beforehand to provide context and build excitement. I think it would be great if you could join us for that part of the event, if you're available. The students would be thrilled to hear from an expert like you, and I know they would find your insights fascinating.

I'll make sure to have plenty of hands-on activities and opportunities for exploration during the observing portion of the event. I want the students to feel like they're actively engaging with the universe, not just passively observing.

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions as we get closer to the event. I'm hoping for clear skies and plenty of astronomical wonders to share with the students!

Emily,

Thank you for your email and for the edits you made to the introduction and conclusion. I agree that they help tie our arguments together more effectively. I have a few minor suggestions for further revisions, which I'll send your way in a separate email.

Regarding conferences, I think the Western History Association and the Latin American Studies Association are excellent options. I have a colleague who presented at the WHA last year and had a great experience. LASA might be a good choice as well, given the focus on Latin American Studies.

I've also been giving some thought to the idea of expanding our project into a book. I think our research could be of interest to a broader audience, and a book would allow us to delve deeper into certain aspects of the topic. What do you think about this idea?

Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Subject: RE: Neues Lehrmaterial für Anfänger

Hallo Hans,

herzlichen Dank für deine Email und die spannenden neuen Lehrmaterialien! Es ist wirklich eine interessante Idee, die Schüler selbst die Regeln entdecken zu lassen. 

Ich habe die Übungen durchgesehen und finde sie sehr gut durchdacht. Eine Idee für eine Ergänzung: Könnten die Schüler nachdem sie die Regeln entdeckt haben, einen kleinen Dialog verfassen, in dem sie die gelernten Strukturen verwenden? Das wäre eine gute Möglichkeit, das Gelernte zu festigen und zu üben.

Was authentische Materialien angeht: In diesem Jahr haben wir uns auf deutsche Musik konzentriert. Die Schüler haben Lieder gehört, die Texte analysiert und die Handlung gezeichnet. Das hat sehr gut funktioniert, besonders mit Liedern von Mark Forster und Helene Fischer. Vielleicht probierst du das ja auch einmal aus.

Ich würde mich auch sehr freuen, wenn du mir einige authentische Ressourcen empfehlen könntest, die du in deinem Unterricht verwendet hast und von denen du denkst, dass sie meinen Studenten gefallen könnten. 

Ich freue mich auf deine Gedanken und hoffe, dass es dir und deinen Studenten gut geht.

Viele Grüße,

Hi Michael,

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we schedule our call for 2 PM EST? That way, we'll have plenty of time to discuss our ideas and plan our next steps.

I've been thinking about our collaboration, and I believe we could create a series of modular learning units that cover key chemistry concepts while incorporating hands-on activities and real-world applications. We could also develop assessments to measure student understanding and engagement.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach and any ideas you have for specific topics or activities we could include.

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same
level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You
say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I
just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost
was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we
can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90
per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the
true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Richard,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with
SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can
decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints
completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with
8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that
is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of
$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within
that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built
house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a
radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same
energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to
a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.
That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional
costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?
Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help
me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from
Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

If you are currently accessing the EOL database via Excel, Access or any 
other means, please contact Colin Tonks (x58885).

EOL intends to stop access to the data within the next month. This means that 
any spreadsheets or Access databases will not function subsequent to this

Subject: Collaboration on dental health educational materials

Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the community center last week. I really enjoyed your presentation on dental health for children. As I mentioned, I'm a primary school teacher and I'm always looking for ways to make learning more engaging for my students.

I think your expertise in dental health would be a fantastic resource for creating educational materials for my students. Would you be interested in collaborating on this project? I'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you and see how we can make dental health fun and interesting for kids.

Please let me know if you're available to meet up and discuss this further. I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Gary,

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the 
front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow 
and fax you a copy.

Subject: RE: New Interactive Graphing Software

Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out about GraphMaster! I haven't heard of it before, but it sounds like an exciting tool that could really enhance our students' learning experience.

I'm particularly interested in how it could be used to create interactive visualizations for probability concepts. I've been working on a new unit on probability and have been trying to find ways to make it more engaging for students. If GraphMaster can help with that, I'd be eager to explore it further.

Would you be open to setting up a time for us to discuss this in more detail? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how it could be applied to our specific lesson plans and any ideas you have for incorporating it into our classrooms.

Also, I wanted to share that I recently discovered a new approach to teaching the concept of standard deviation that has been really effective in my classes. I'd be happy to share it with you if you're interested.

Looking forward to collaborating more on this!

Hi Dr. Jones,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, I've been considering adopting a German Shepherd, and I wanted to get your expert advice on heartworm prevention for this specific breed. Are German Shepherds more susceptible to heartworm disease compared to other breeds? If so, what special precautions should I take to keep my future furry friend healthy?

I'm really excited about the upcoming pet adoption event at the community center. I want to make sure I'm well-informed about heartworm prevention so I can be a responsible dog owner and perhaps even help other adopters at the event.

Thank you in advance for your help!

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi

Would you be interested in working on a series of educational resources that highlight the contributions of African Americans in the field of medicine and health science?

As for the healthy aging and swallowing safety workshop, I was thinking we could hold it at the Willowbrook Senior Center on Saturday, March 21st, from 10 am to 12 pm. This would give us enough time to cover the essential topics and allow for a Q&A session. I'll need to coordinate with the senior center to ensure we have the necessary space and resources.

I'm also excited to learn that our children attend the same school! It's always nice to have a connection outside of our committee work. Perhaps we could arrange a playdate for them sometime.

Your deep understanding of the art and its cultural significance shines through in every word.

Let's set up a time to chat further about your goals and how I can support you in this transition.

On a personal note, I hope your daughter is doing well. My son has been asking about her lately, as he's been delving deeper into his studies of Eastern philosophy. Perhaps we can arrange for them to meet and discuss their shared interests sometime.

Dear Dr. Patel,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Akira Nakamura, and I am a historian and curator at the Justice Matters Museum in San Francisco. I recently attended the ""Space Exploration and Indigenous Rights"" conference where I had the pleasure of hearing your presentation on the potential impact of space missions on indigenous communities and their land rights.

I was deeply impressed by your insights and the sensitivity with which you approached this complex topic. As someone who is committed to raising awareness about social justice issues, I believe your work is crucial in ensuring that the benefits of space exploration are shared equitably and that the rights of indigenous peoples are respected.

I am currently curating a new exhibit at our museum titled ""Internment, Displacement, and Resistance: A Global Perspective."" The exhibit aims to draw connections between the Japanese American internment and the experiences of other marginalized communities throughout history, including indigenous peoples affected by space exploration and resource extraction.

I would be immensely grateful if you could share your thoughts on how we might incorporate perspectives from astrobiology and environmental science into this exhibit. I believe your expertise could provide valuable context and help us tell a more comprehensive story.

If you are interested in collaborating, I would be happy to arrange a call to discuss this further. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: RE: Indigenous Language Preservation Project

Hi Jordan,

Thank you for reaching out! Your project sounds fascinating, and I would be honored to contribute my expertise in philately and postal history. I have some experience with indigenous languages as well, as I've collected stamps depicting indigenous cultures from around the world.

I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss how I can best assist with your research. Just let me know your availability, and we can set something up.

Looking forward to working with you on this important project.

Best,

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

Subject: Update on Sarah Thompson's case

Dear Linda,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to update you on Sarah Thompson's case. As you know, we've been closely monitoring her gestational diabetes throughout her pregnancy. Unfortunately, her condition has worsened, and I believe it's in the best interest of both Sarah and the baby to induce labor early.

I've discussed the risks and benefits of induction with Sarah, and she has agreed to the procedure. Can you please schedule some time with her to go over the induction process in more detail and answer any questions she may have?

Also, please make sure she understands the importance of monitoring her blood sugar levels closely during the induction process and after delivery. We'll need to keep a close eye on both her and the baby in the hours and days following the birth.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on curriculum update

Emily,

Thank you so much for sharing your paper and the information about the XYZ Analyzer. I had a chance to read through your work, and I'm impressed by the results you've achieved. The XYZ Analyzer definitely sounds like a valuable tool that our students should learn how to use.

I'll look into the educational discounts and see if we can incorporate it into our lab setup. Your paper will be a great resource for our students to reference as well.

As for the conference, I do plan on attending! It's always a great opportunity to learn about the latest developments and network with other professionals. I'd love to meet up and discuss your presentation in more detail. Perhaps we could grab a coffee during one of the breaks?

Let me know if that works for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you there and continuing our discussion on curriculum development.

Best,

Dear Elin,

Thank you for your email and for taking the initiative to get our project started. I am equally excited about our collaboration and the potential impact of our research.

I agree that a video conference call is a good first step. I am available next week on Tuesday from 10am to 12pm CET, or Thursday from 2pm to 4pm CET. Please let me know which time works best for you.

In preparation for our call, I have been reviewing the literature on language education policies and outcomes in the Nordic countries. I look forward to discussing this research and how it might inform our project.

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

Subject: RE: Congratulations on your new paper!

Hi David,

I would be absolutely thrilled to collaborate with you on this project! It sounds like a fantastic opportunity to bring together our different areas of expertise and potentially make some groundbreaking discoveries.

I'm happy to help with the remote sensing and geospatial analysis components of the research. I have a lot of experience working with satellite imagery and GIS data for monitoring mangrove ecosystems, and I think we could use similar approaches to study the fossil sites you mentioned.

I'm also very interested in the idea of co-authoring a paper on the broader implications of our findings for understanding the intersections between human evolution and environmental change. I think this could be a really exciting direction for our collaboration.

Let's set up a time to discuss the grant application and start putting together a plan for the research trip. I'm attaching a draft of a project proposal that I've been working on that might be relevant to our discussions.

I can't wait to get started on this collaboration!

Subject: RE: Seeking advice for upcoming research trip to Vietnam

Jordan,

It's great to hear from you! I'd be happy to offer some tips for staying healthy while traveling in Vietnam. The key is mostly just being very careful about the water - always drink bottled or boiled water, and avoid raw or undercooked foods from street vendors. I can send you a list of my favorite restaurants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City that I trust.

I'm really intrigued by your research into early Protestant missions and would love to learn more. In my work, I've found some evidence that the spread of certain parasites may have been influenced by the migration patterns of different religious groups, so I think our areas of study could definitely inform each other. I'd be interested in getting your thoughts on how the religious practices and diets of those early missionaries might have impacted the local food systems.

I'm traveling for a conference next week but I'd be glad to set up a call the week after, if that works for you? Let me know your availability.

Jennifer, 

This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS 
with.  In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend 
projections, he had the ""Professional Services"" highlighted with a bunch of 
question marks.  It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ 
$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day.  Either way, 
it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works).  I'll be going 
over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys.  I'll 
keep you posted.

Clarification on the below.

Point #1 our position has been $3MM on software (they are saying they need 
$4MM to get the deal done.)

Additionally, they want Maintenance and professional services to go with the 
dollar amount.  $2.4MM is their position here.  I need your help to clarify 
with each group who is on board with maintenance and profesional services.  
BMC's #2 guy Jeff Hawn told Jim Crowder this was critical for them.

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the ""accepable-to-BMC method"" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

		 Subject: BMC Update

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to ""purchase commitment"", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
""accepable-to-BMC method"" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Subject: RE: Idea for an art-science collaboration

Emily,

I absolutely love this idea! Combining art and geology is a fantastic way to engage our students and help them appreciate the world around us. I'm definitely on board for this collaboration.

As we plan the project, I think it would be great to invite a local geologist to speak to the students and provide some inspiration for their artwork. It could be really enriching for them to hear from an expert in the field.

What do you think about organizing an art exhibition at the end of the project to showcase their work? We could hold it at the Oakville Community Center and invite families and community members to attend.

I'm excited to start brainstorming ideas for this project! Let me know when you're free to meet and discuss further.

Best,

Sarah-Joy,
Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

I spoke to John briefly this morning.  Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week.  John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS.  I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP.  My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon.  Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

Subject: RE: Collaboration on an article about paper and folding

Hello Emily,

Thank you for sending over your initial research. It's fascinating to see the connections between the linguistic roots of words related to paper and folding in Old English and Proto-Germanic languages. I can definitely see how incorporating the history and techniques of origami could add depth to your article.

I've attached a document with some information on the specific terms used in origami, along with their English translations and a brief explanation of their origins. I think you'll find it interesting to see how many of these terms have roots in Japanese culture and have been adapted or adopted into the English language.

I've also included a few resources on the history of origami and its influence on Japanese art and culture. I hope these will provide valuable context for your research.

As for our discussion, I'm available next Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, if either of those times work for you. Please let me know what suits you best.

Thank you again for the opportunity to collaborate on this project. I'm excited to see how our combined knowledge will enhance the article!

Take a look at this spreadsheet.  I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices.  Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties?  The Roma deal looks much better.

THE 10 TOP THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT WIN XP

         on and on about it myself. But now it's officially
         here, what's left to say? Not much, but just
         this: A list of the few features and issues

    XP: PHOOEY ON YOUIE! WHY IPOD IS THE APPLE OF OUR EYES TODAY

    Apple poured some precipitation on
    Microsoft's XP-week parade by introducing
    its new MP3 player. But the iPod isn't
    just some mischief at Microsoft's expense.
    Instead, it's a product that embodies
    Apple at its very best and makes you wonder:
    Is Apple underestimating itself by
    not making more things for the rest of
    us?

Recently we signed Letters of Interest (LOI's) with three brokers.  The 
letters contemplate our interest in providing these brokers with the ability 
to execute on behalf of their customers on EnronOnline.  Below are the terms 
of these transactions as outlined in the LOI's.  I have contacted many of the 
desk heads prior to entering into the LOI's and outlined the general terms of 
these transactions (J Arnold, J Nowlan, K McGowan, U Ek, S Hastings, K 
Presto,J Hawthorn).  We are also in discussions with the following brokers E 
D & F Man (US Gas and US Power), GFI (global gas, power, coal and emissions), 
PVM (European Crude and Products), and Prebon (world-wide gas & power).  We 
would appreciate if you could give us the names of additional brokers we 
could talk to that are active in your products.

Please pay particular attention to the Amerex terms which include the ability 
to initiate executions telephonically using website prices.  Enrons 
obligation to transact telephonically on website prices are good faith only.  
This term allows Amerex to get around a exclusivity clause with Altra which 
they are trying to negotiate out of.

Please review the terms and contact me at (ext 3-0397) concerning any 
comments or concerns that need to be addressed prior to the execution of 
definitive agreements.

Thank you for sharing your draft presentation. I read through it and found your analysis of the partition process to be thorough and well-supported. However, I think you may be underestimating the strategic importance of Kashmir to India's national security, particularly given its border with China and Pakistan.

I've outlined some counterpoints in the attached document, which I hope will enrich our discussion at the conference. I'm looking forward to a lively and informative panel.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Channel Inside FERC

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Dear Dr. Chen,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Samantha Smith, and I'm a science writer focusing on oncology. We met briefly at the Skin Cancer Research Conference last year, where I was covering the event and interviewing experts in the field. I remember being impressed by your work on innovative treatments for melanoma.

I'm reaching out because I'm currently working on an article about a new treatment for melanoma that has shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials. As one of the lead researchers on this study, I would be grateful to have your insights and expertise for my article.

Would you be available for a short interview via phone or email to discuss the treatment, its potential implications, and the next steps for your research? I would be happy to work around your schedule and provide you with more details about the article.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Subject: RE: Exciting new fish weir discovery

Hi Jordan,

I'm thrilled that you're interested in collaborating on this project! I think our combined expertise will be invaluable in unlocking the secrets of this site and its broader implications.

To get the ball rolling, I suggest we schedule a call for early next week to discuss our research objectives and start outlining the grant proposal. I'm free on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, if either of those times work for you.

In the meantime, I'll start compiling a more detailed site report and literature review to share with you before our call. I'll also reach out to a few colleagues who may be able to provide additional insights or resources.

Please let me know if you have any other thoughts or suggestions as we move forward with this exciting collaboration!

Best regards,

Subject: RE: New telescope proposal

Hi Michael,

That's great to hear that you're interested in collaborating! I think your work on dark matter halos and star formation rates would be a perfect fit for this proposal. We could potentially even expand the scope to include some of your simulation results as part of the science case.

As for the timeline, I'm hoping to submit the proposal to the NSF by the end of the summer. That would give us a few months to refine the science goals, draft the proposal, and get feedback from other collaborators. Let me know if that works for you and if there are any specific parts of the proposal you'd like to take the lead on.

I'm attaching a draft of the science justification section that I've been working on. Feel free to take a look and let me know your thoughts. I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss further if you have any questions or ideas.

Best,

Subject: Feeling a bit stuck

Hey Amanda,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the last few days of school before break. I've been thinking about our last conversation and I wanted to reach out. 

As much as I love teaching, lately I've been questioning whether I'm really cut out for this. The pushback from some parents has me second-guessing my whole approach. I know in my heart that student-centered, experiential learning is the way to go, but it's hard not to doubt myself sometimes. I'm worried I'm not tough enough for this job.

I don't mean to dump all my angst on you, I just don't know many other teachers as innovative as you who could relate. Do you ever feel this way? How do you stay motivated and true to your vision in the face of resistance? I'd love any words of wisdom you have.

I hope you have some fun plans for summer break! I'm thinking of doing a language immersion program in Spain, but we'll see. 

Anyway, I'd love to catch up more sometime soon. Let me know if you want to grab lunch or a drink after school lets out.

Take care,
Rebecca",research,No

Hi Samantha,

It's great to hear from you! I've been really looking forward to working together on this project, and I think it's a fantastic opportunity to share your important research with a broader audience.

I'd love to set up a video call to discuss the project in more detail. How about next Friday, April 15th at 1pm EST? If that doesn't work for you, let me know some other times that might be better.

I've been giving some thought to potential angles for the articles and videos, and I'm excited to bounce ideas off you and get your input. I think we could create some really compelling content that highlights the significance of your work and its implications for marine conservation.

Looking forward to chatting more next week!

Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

David,

Thank you for your prompt response. Thursday morning works well for me, so let's schedule our call for then. I'll send you a calendar invite with the video call details.

I'm intrigued by the study you mentioned and would love to discuss it further. I have some thoughts on how it relates to the work I've been doing on regulatory capture and how it can influence market competition.

Looking forward to our call and the conference!

Subject: RE: Interesting case study on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Hi Jordan,

Thanks for sharing the case study! I read through it and found the anatomical insights fascinating. The way the fibrotic changes in the lung tissue lead to impaired gas exchange is truly intriguing.

I'd be happy to collaborate on an article for our group. In fact, I've been working on a similar project, trying to create educational content about lung anatomy and physiology for students. If you're interested, we could combine our efforts and create something more comprehensive.

Let me know what you think!

Olivia,

Your email couldn't have come at a better time! I'm thrilled to hear about your new discovery. I'd be more than happy to collaborate with you on this research paper. From what you've described, it sounds like this fossil could shed new light on theropod evolution during the Cretaceous period.

I've been doing some work on the phylogenetic relationships of theropods lately, and this new fossil might just be the missing piece we've been looking for. I can't wait to see the data and specimens you've collected.

Please send over any relevant information, and let's set up a time to discuss our approach for the paper. I'm confident that with our combined expertise, we can make a significant contribution to the field.

Looking forward to working with you on this exciting project!

I went through the code on Stack overflow and like I was trying to explain earlier in the office today, We have broadly done the same thing as the code shared by you. We have masked  the rows and columns with missing values, However since our way of masking out is slightly more complicated , therefore may take more time incase of larger matrices. Hence using the code on Stackoverflow would be beneficial. Also, the code provided on Stack-Overflow is only for the case of non-negative least squares, so needs to be used accordingly.",student,No

Subject: RE: Social Justice in Earth Science

Alex,

Thanks so much for sending those resources! I've been reading through them and they're really inspiring. I love the idea of creating a lesson together that we could co-teach. 

I was thinking we could focus on the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities and tie that into a lesson on climate science and the greenhouse effect. We could have students analyze data on climate impacts in different communities and discuss the historical and social factors that contribute to these disparities.

I'd be happy to come up with a draft outline for the lesson and send it your way. Then we can bounce ideas back and forth and refine it together.

Excited to collaborate on this!

Dear Dr. Richards,

Thank you for your email. I am thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project and to have the opportunity to work alongside you and the team.

I have been reviewing the latest research on Homo erectus and early human migrations, and I believe we have a strong foundation for our excavation. I will make sure to have all the necessary documents and equipment ready for our departure.

Please let me know when you would like to schedule the team meeting. I am available anytime next week, except for Tuesday afternoon when I have a lecture to give.

If you have any specific topics or research questions you would like me to focus on during the meeting, please let me know. I am happy to prepare any additional materials or presentations beforehand.

I look forward to our adventure in Africa and the discoveries that await us.

It was great meeting you at the Sustainability and Human Evolution conference last week. I really enjoyed your presentation on sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. I think there could be some fascinating intersections between your work and my research on early human migrations and adaptations.

I mentioned that I'm planning a research trip to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania later this year. If you're interested, I would love for you to join me. I think your expertise in environmental science and sustainability could bring a valuable perspective to the project.

Hey Liam,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that I submitted our research paper on using machine learning for radar-based weather prediction to the Journal of Meteorological Research last night. I'm really excited about the potential impact our work could have on the field.

I was thinking, while we await the peer review process, we should start preparing for the upcoming International Meteorological Conference. If our paper is accepted, we'll have the opportunity to present our findings to a global audience of meteorologists and researchers. It would be a great chance to get feedback and make some valuable connections.

Let me know if you have any ideas for our presentation. I think we should focus on the key findings from our paper and the potential applications of our techniques for real-time weather forecasting.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Hi Emily,

Great, I'll see you tomorrow at 2 PM in the conference room. I've also been digging into FinStealer and have found some additional information that I think will be helpful in our efforts to combat this malware.

I've reached out to a few of my contacts in the cybersecurity community, and it seems that FinStealer has been responsible for several high-profile breaches in the past few months. The attackers behind the malware are believed to be a sophisticated criminal organization with ties to Eastern Europe.

I'll put together a summary of what I've learned and share it with you before our meeting tomorrow. We'll need to develop a comprehensive strategy to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of FinStealer on our clients' systems.

Looking forward to working with you on this, Emily. Let's show these cybercriminals that we mean business!

Hi John,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm excited to collaborate with you on this webinar. I agree that focusing on edge computing, IoT, and speed sensor technologies is a great idea. We could also consider covering topics like data security and privacy in autonomous vehicles, as these are becoming increasingly important concerns.

As for speakers, I have a few ideas:

1. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned expert in edge computing from the University of Technology
2. Michael Chen, the CTO of a leading automotive company who has been working on autonomous vehicle projects
3. Dr. David Lee, a professor specializing in IoT technologies at the Institute of Advanced Automotive Studies

We could also reach out to some of our contacts in the industry to see if they'd be interested in participating.

To promote the webinar, we could create a dedicated website and social media accounts, as well as reach out to relevant online communities and industry publications.

Let me know what you think, and we can schedule a call to discuss the details further.

Jeff,

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday. 


Phillip

Bruce,

Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have 
an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed 
specification list.  I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when 
complete for a final bid.  Probably in early to mid June.

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on game design and economics

Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about my work. It's always a pleasure to connect with someone passionate about exploring the intersection of game design and economics.

I'd be happy to share some insights and resources with you. One key concept to understand is the role of incentives and rewards in driving player behavior. By carefully designing the economic systems within your game, you can encourage players to engage in desired actions and create a sense of progression and achievement.

Some resources that might be helpful for you include:

1. ""The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses"" by Jesse Schell - This book provides a comprehensive overview of game design principles and includes discussions on economics and player motivation.
2. ""Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals"" by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman - Another excellent resource that covers the fundamentals of game design, including the role of rules and systems.
3. The Extra Credits YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCredits) - They have several videos that delve into game design and economics, such as their series on ""The Problem with Video Game Economies.""

Feel free to explore these resources and let me know if you have any specific questions. I'm always happy to discuss these topics further and provide more tailored advice based on your project.

Best of luck with your game development journey!

Hi Liam,

It was wonderful to meet you at the Vaccine Development Conference in Santa Barbara last week. I really enjoyed our discussions about the potential applications of radiation in vaccine development and the challenges we face in this field.

I was impressed by your presentation on the latest advancements in immunology research and how it can inform vaccine development strategies. I believe our research interests align quite well, and I would love to explore potential collaborations.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to share some of the data from my recent experiments on the effects of radiation on viral proteins. I think it could complement your work on immune system response to viral antigens.

Let me know if you'd like to chat more about this or meet up for a virtual coffee sometime.

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

Subject: FIMAT loan agreement

John - the FIMAT loan agreeemnt will prohibit ENE from using loan proceeds as 
follows:
No part of the proceeds of any Advance hereunder will be used for 
""purchasing"" or ""carrying"" any ""margin stock"" within the respective meanings 
of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

Do you know whether you engage in purchasing or carrying margin stock?  I 
will check with legal as well.

Subject: Following up from GIRI conference

Hi David,

It was great meeting you at the GIRI conference in Newbridge last month. I really enjoyed our conversation about the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between our fields. I've been thinking more about how geothermal energy could be used to power facilities involved in vaccine production and research.

I'd love to hear more about your latest work on HIV vaccine development. Have you made any breakthroughs since we last spoke? I'm curious to know if there are any specific challenges in your research that might benefit from a fresh perspective or input from the geothermal energy field.

Let me know if you're interested in catching up further. I'm happy to discuss potential collaborations or just share ideas.

Best regards,
Emily",research,No

As for your idea about co-authoring a paper, I think it's a great suggestion. Our research could definitely make a valuable contribution to the field, and it would be fantastic to share our findings with others. I'm happy to discuss this further and start brainstorming ideas for the paper.

On a personal note, I wanted to let you know that I recently adopted a puppy. He's a energetic little guy and keeps me on my toes! I'll have to send you a picture sometime.

Looking forward to your response and continuing our work together.

Emily,

This is incredible news! I've been eagerly following your work on prehistoric fish weirs, and this discovery sounds like a major breakthrough. I would be thrilled to collaborate with you on this project.

As you know, I'm currently writing a book on the history of commercial fishing in the Caribbean, and this new evidence could significantly enhance my research. I'm considering taking a sabbatical next semester to focus on the book and your excavation project.

I have a few ideas on how we might approach the historical context and implications of this discovery. Would you be available for a call next week to discuss the project in more detail?

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",corporate,No

Subject: Exciting new developments in our project!

Hey Liam,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some exciting news about our collaborative project. We've just secured additional funding from the National Science Foundation to expand our fieldwork and data collection efforts. This means we'll be able to collect an even more comprehensive dataset and really dive deep into the stratigraphy of the Morrison Formation.

I'm thrilled about the potential implications this could have for our understanding of the Late Jurassic ecosystems in North America. With the extra resources, we'll be able to bring on a couple of graduate students to assist with the fieldwork and data analysis, which should help us make even more progress.

I've attached a draft of the revised project proposal for your review. Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback. I'm also happy to discuss further over the phone or video chat if you prefer.

Looking forward to your thoughts and to our continued collaboration!

Petra,

I'm glad you're as excited as I am about this trip! Your English is already fantastic, but I'm sure you'll have plenty of opportunities to practice while we're in Jamaica.

I've booked our flights and found a great guesthouse in Kingston that's close to all the main attractions. It has excellent reviews and a friendly atmosphere, so I think we'll feel right at home. I'll send you the booking confirmation and details shortly.

As for the accommodations in Ocho Rios and Montego Bay, I have a few family members who might be able to host us for a night or two. It would be a great opportunity for you to experience true Jamaican hospitality! Let me know if you're comfortable with that, and I'll make the necessary arrangements.

I'll also make a list of the places we absolutely must visit and send it your way. Can't wait to share my culture with you!

Dear Grace,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind invitation to speak to your class. I would be delighted to give a guest lecture on the role of women in early human societies. 

I think it's crucial for students to understand the deep history of gender roles and how they have evolved over time. I can provide an overview of what the archaeological and fossil evidence tells us about the lives of early human females, and how that compares to modern human societies.

I'm happy to work with you to ensure the lecture is appropriate for your students' level and fits well with your curriculum. Please let me know what date and time would work best for you, and if there are any specific topics or themes you'd like me to focus on.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this!

I'm writing to share a bit more about my own research on using data analysis to improve math instruction. I've attached a recent paper I published on the topic. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on how this kind of approach could be applied in history education as well.

It's called the ""SuperAccurate ADC"" and it's supposed to have an incredibly low noise floor and high resolution.

I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm glad you brought this to my attention. The new Zika strain is indeed a cause for concern, and I believe it requires a coordinated effort from public health professionals like ourselves to mitigate its impact.

I would be more than happy to share with you the details of our vector control program here in Singapore. Our multidisciplinary approach, which includes public education campaigns, targeted vector control measures, and close monitoring of disease transmission, has proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of vector-borne diseases in our city.

I'm available for a call next Tuesday, April 20th, at 10 AM EST. Please let me know if this works for you, and feel free to invite any other colleagues who might benefit from the discussion.

In the meantime, I'll gather some resources and case studies that I think will be useful for our conversation.

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Subject: Exciting new solar observation technique

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well! I just read your recent paper on the new solar observation technique, and I must say, I'm truly impressed. The implications of this technique for our understanding of solar dynamics are fascinating.

I was wondering if you could elaborate on how this technique could be applied to my research on historical solar observations. I'm particularly interested in how it might help us uncover new insights into past solar events and their impact on Earth.

I would be grateful for any advice or suggestions you might have. Perhaps we could even collaborate on a project combining our expertise?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Subject: Option Analysis on NG Price Book

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi

Dear Dr. Johnson,

I'm writing to share some fantastic news! The students have completed their digital art pieces, and they are truly impressive. We've created an online gallery to showcase their work, and the response from the school community has been overwhelmingly positive.

I'd like to invite you to the virtual exhibition, which will take place next Friday at 7:00 pm. You'll have the opportunity to view the students' artwork, hear them present the historical significance behind each piece, and provide feedback.

Please let me know if you can attend, and I'll send you the link to join the exhibition.

Thank you once again for your invaluable contribution to this project. The students have learned so much about early American history and have developed a deeper appreciation for the artistic process.

I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Thank you so much for your help! The visual aids you sent were really helpful in making sense of atomic structure. I think I have a better grasp on it now. 

One thing I'm still a little confused about is how the periodic table is organized. Can you explain why the elements are arranged the way they are?

Hi Emily,

Congratulations to your daughter and her team on their success at the tournament! It's great to hear she's enjoying soccer so much.

I've finished reviewing the manuscript draft and have sent you my comments. Overall, I think it's shaping up well. We may want to consider adding a bit more discussion on the potential clinical implications of our findings.

I'll start working on the poster content today and will send you a draft early next week for feedback.

Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow.

Subject: Collaborative project proposal

Dear Jacques,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding our recent discussion about creating a collaborative art project for my kindergarten class based on local historical landmarks. I think this could be a wonderful opportunity for the students to learn about the rich history of our region while also expressing their creativity through art.

I was thinking we could focus on the World War I fortifications you spoke about at the historical society meeting. Perhaps you could provide some historical context and photographs of the sites, and I could guide the students in creating paintings or drawings inspired by these landmarks.

What do you think? I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we could make this project a success. Please let me know if you're interested in collaborating and if you have any suggestions for other historical sites we could include.

Best regards,

I'm thrilled that you found the paper interesting and see potential for a collaboration! Your ideas on using the synthetic carbohydrates in cell models sound fantastic. A virtual coffee chat to discuss this in more detail would be great - how about next Wednesday at 10 AM my time (which should be 1 PM for you)? Let me know if that works.

Absolutely, let's plan to meet up at the symposium! I'll be presenting a poster on our latest findings on Thursday afternoon. We could grab lunch and discuss our collaboration plans in person then.

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen

Kirk - My update was regarding storyline video with actors/actresses. Enron
Legal is now reviewing the scripts we will need for this video shoot.

This timeframe communicated below is NOT applicable for the Enron experts
who will be filming expert stories. The video shoots for the Enron Expert
Stories will be held December 10th and 11th and Ann Chen will be working on
this (I have forwarded her your response below). However, I agree with your
comment to Phillip. We need to identify these additional Enron experts to
be filmed as soon as possible.

Sorry for the confusion and again, thanks for your help.

The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in

additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls

This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as

media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

Subject:	El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

Subject: VaR Methodology Change

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.

Hey Michael,

I hope you made it back home safely after the conference. I wanted to reach out and thank you for carpooling with me and for your collaboration during our workshop. It was great to have your support and insights throughout the event.

I came across a fantastic online resource that I think you'll find useful in your geometry classes. It's called ""Geometry Gizmos"" (www.geometrygizmos.com) and it offers interactive lessons and activities that help students visualize and understand geometric concepts. I think it could be a great supplement to our existing curriculum.

Let me know if you have any other resources or ideas to share from the conference. I'm always looking for ways to improve my teaching and help our students succeed.

Thanks again for being such a great colleague and friend. I look forward to brainstorming more ways to engage our students in the wonderful world of geometry!

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle
with John Elway? No.  Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No.

But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have
agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's
capable hands and should be completed next week.

In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday
(3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors.  John Galperin (on our

Hi Alex,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about this topic. I completely agree that including the Kashmir conflict in your lesson plan would provide a valuable perspective for your students.

As it happens, I recently published a paper on the intersection of the Kashmir conflict and environmental issues in the region. I'd be more than happy to share my findings with you and discuss how they could be incorporated into your lesson plan.

I'm available to meet for coffee next week, and I'd also be happy to give a guest lecture to your class if you think that would be beneficial for your students. Just let me know what works best for you.

Emily,

Thank you for sending the draft! I've had a chance to read through it and I'm impressed by the depth of research and the compelling connections you've made between ancient Aboriginal adaptations and contemporary coastal management challenges. Your writing style is engaging and clear.

I have a few suggestions for further strengthening the paper:

1. In the introduction, could you provide a bit more context on the current state of Aboriginal cultural heritage sites threatened by sea level rise? Some specific examples would help ground the discussion.

2. In the section on natural adaptation processes, I think we could expand on the role of sediment transport in shaping coastlines. I can provide some additional data from our North Sea studies if that would be helpful.

3. I wonder if we could include a brief case study of a modern coastal community that has successfully implemented adaptation strategies informed by ancient knowledge. This could help illustrate the practical applications of our research.

Overall, this is a strong start and I'm excited to continue working with you on this important paper. Let me know your thoughts on my suggestions.

Best regards,

Lucy,

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.

Subject: RE: Collaborating on visualizations for my research project

Alex,

Thanks for the additional details on your goals for the visualizations. I think we can definitely create something that meets your needs and effectively communicates the complex concepts in your research.

I'll start by reviewing the data you send over and exploring some initial visualization ideas. I'm thinking we could create a series of linked visualizations that allow users to explore the different data sets and how they relate to each other. We could also incorporate interactive elements like sliders or dropdowns that let users control which data is displayed and how it's visualized.

I'll put together some initial sketches and mockups and send them your way for feedback. We can then iterate on the designs until we have a set of visualizations that effectively convey the key findings and concepts in your research.

In terms of timeline, I think we should aim to have the initial designs completed within the next month, with time for revisions and final tweaks after that. That should give us plenty of time to get the visualizations finalized before your paper submission deadline.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. I'm excited to get started on this project and see what we can create together!

Best,

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

I would like more detail about how much margin my open positions require and how the muni's are treated with regard to margin.  The call's I am short are way out of the money.  The only positions that are changing very much in value are the Enron shares I am long and the Enron puts I am short.  I would consider closing those positions.  I would like to put the maximum possible into Muni's.

1.3M available but using this full amount would not give us any cushion in

Hey Ethan,

I hope you're doing well! I came across this fascinating article on chemical mimicry in Salticidae spiders and thought of you. It discusses how some jumping spiders use chemical cues to mimic the pheromones of other species to avoid predation or even lure prey. I know you've done some work on chemical communication in orb weavers, so I thought you might find it intriguing.

Let me know if you have time to chat about it sometime. I'd love to get your thoughts on how this might compare to the chemical strategies used by your study species.

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for your email. I understand the importance of accurate solutions for the success of our research project. I will start working on the preparations right away and will keep you updated on the progress.

Regarding the timeline, I should be able to have the 0.1 M HCl and 0.05 M NaOH solutions ready by the end of this week. The 1% (w/v) SDS solution will take a bit longer, as I need to ensure the proper dissolution of the SDS. I expect to have it ready by early next week.

Please let me know if this timeline works for you. If you need the solutions earlier, I can try to prioritize the preparations.

Hi Ethan,

I hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our last conversation and wanted to pick your brain a bit more about using computer vision technology in my spider research. I'm particularly interested in analyzing the visual signals that spiders use to communicate with each other, and I think computer vision could be a powerful tool for quantifying these signals and understanding how they vary across different species and contexts.

Do you have any suggestions for good resources or tutorials to help me get started with computer vision? I'm also curious to hear your thoughts on the best programming languages and software packages to use for this kind of analysis. Any advice you have would be much appreciated!

Subject: Large Deal Alert

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to 
Mark Whitt in Denver.  

Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.

Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Hi Ethan,

Thank you for your enthusiastic response! I'm thrilled that you see potential in this idea and are willing to collaborate with me on it.

I agree that exchanging papers and research would be a great starting point. I'll send you some of my work on radar technology and its applications in meteorology and atmospheric science. I'm particularly interested in how we might adapt these techniques to detect and track NEOs, especially those that could pose a threat to Earth.

I'm also curious to learn more about your research on asteroid impacts and mass extinctions. It's a fascinating topic with significant implications for our understanding of Earth's history and future.

Perhaps we could set up a call next week to discuss our respective research in more detail and brainstorm some ideas for a potential joint project. Let me know your availability, and I'll send over some reading material in the meantime.

Michelle
Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).

Sheri

When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Kirk -

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I was wondering if you had any thoughts on how we should structure our presentation. I think it would be great to start with an overview of our school and the challenges we faced with vocabulary instruction. Then, we could dive into the details of the challenge and share some success stories from our students.

Let me know what you think! I'm open to any suggestions or ideas you might have. We should also start thinking about booking our flights and hotel soon. I'd be happy to take care of that if you'd like.

Looking forward to working with you on this amazing opportunity!

Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Details of Nitrogen Pressures and volumes.    For a new scheme we would want  
100 psi, to suit the nitrogen ring main. Current supply pressures from BOC 
are not relevant. Volume is 28-29,000 rm3/hr at Wilton and total of approx 
45,900rm3/hr when the other  sites are included.   This issue of supply to 
the other sites could be a problem as BOC are physically entrenched in the 
piped supply arrangements.

Hi Michael,

It was wonderful to meet you at the Innovations in Mathematics Education Conference last week. I'm so glad you enjoyed my presentation on collaborative learning strategies. Your insights and experiences implementing similar strategies in your classroom were fascinating.

I really enjoyed our conversation about the potential of technology to enhance mathematics education. The workshop we attended together, ""Digital Tools for Engaging Mathematics Learners,"" provided some great ideas that I'm eager to explore further.

I'd love to stay in touch and continue our discussion. Perhaps we can share resources and strategies that we find effective in our respective classrooms. If you're interested, I'd be happy to send you some articles and tools I've come across recently.

Looking forward to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating in the future!

buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents

i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.  
whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to 
here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the 
weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people 
realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any 
problems...bombs away.

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....

Jacques,

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language ""Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment"" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.

Thank you,

Hi Dr. Johnson,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm glad you found my previous work relevant to our current project. The sudden appearance of a new species in the fossil record is indeed intriguing. During my master's research, I encountered a similar phenomenon, and I suspect it might be related to a rapid evolutionary event or a gap in the fossil record.

I have a few papers and datasets that could provide some context for our findings. I'll send them over to you later today. Perhaps we can set up a meeting next week to discuss this further and brainstorm potential explanations?

I'm excited to work together on this mystery!

Greg,

I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed t=
he deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreem=
ent.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What w=
ill happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since =
the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute=
 an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.

You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me =
previously.  Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not=
 looking at old numbers.  Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of tru=
e costs and expected loan.

Thank you,

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=
ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=
rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=
 get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=
t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=
ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=
ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=
d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =
is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=
1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=
nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=
 of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=
how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=
r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =
and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=
bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=
 greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=
ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=
ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=
en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=
ts each change will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=
 had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =
overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=
ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=
ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=
us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =
final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.

I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any qu=
estions today.

Thank you for reaching out! I thoroughly enjoyed our conversations in Cape Town and found your presentation on the Pilgrim Fathers' journey and its historical significance to be thought-provoking. I am definitely interested in exploring a collaboration on a paper that combines our perspectives on human migration and its impact on ecosystems.

I think it would be fascinating to delve into the role of faith and spirituality in shaping human relationships with the environment, as well as the relevance of traditional ecological knowledge to modern conservation efforts. Perhaps we could structure the paper around a series of case studies that illustrate these themes, drawing on examples from both history and contemporary contexts.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

Hi Emily,

Tuesday at 2 PM Sydney time works great for me. I'll send you a calendar invite with the video call link.

I'll also start compiling my research on the cultural significance of sites in the Northern Territory and how they've been affected by European settlement. I'll focus on gathering data and case studies that support our main arguments.

Looking forward to our call next week!

Best,

Subject: Re: Texas Revolution Research Trip

Hi Carlos,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking more about our research trip and I wanted to share some thoughts.

I think we should definitely plan to visit the Alamo and the San Jacinto Battlefield, as those are key sites related to the Texas Revolution. I also think it would be valuable to visit some of the smaller battle sites, like Concepción and Refugio, to get a sense of the broader scope of the conflict.

I'm happy to book the flights and hotels if you want to focus on arranging our visits to the archives and historical sites. Let me know what you think!

Best,

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Dear Akira,

2 PM JST on Monday is perfect. I'll make sure to have some images and information about the Meiji-era textiles ready to share with you during our call.

After our conversation, I'd also like to propose the idea of co-authoring a paper or exhibition catalog that explores the relationship between traditional Japanese textiles and the cultural significance of motifs in Meiji-era art. I believe our collaboration could lead to a valuable contribution to the field.

Looking forward to our call on Monday,

unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

Subject: Gas Implied Volatility Smile

John, Mike

I work for the London Research team and am looking at 
some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.
Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done 
some fundamental research regarding 
the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.

I would be grateful if you tell me 
what you have done or suggest 
someone else that I could ask.

Dear Aisha,

Thank you for your enthusiastic response! I'm thrilled to hear more about your ""Ethics in Action"" course and the grant proposal. It sounds like an incredible opportunity to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and I would be honored to contribute as a guest lecturer.

I would love to read your article on the use of narrative in nursing ethics education. It sounds like a fascinating piece, and I'm sure it will provide valuable insights for our collaboration. Please feel free to send me the draft of your grant proposal as well. I'd be happy to review it and provide feedback from my perspective.

How about we schedule a video call next week to discuss our potential collaboration in more detail? I'm available on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning, if that works for you. We could also explore the possibility of co-teaching a joint course or seminar in the future.

an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.",corporate,Yes

Emily,

It's so good to hear from you! I was just thinking about our Davis days the other day and smiling at those memories. I'm glad you reached out.

Your project sounds fascinating! The intersection of HIV and COVID-19 immunity is such a hot topic right now. I'm not surprised you're at the forefront of it. New York must be an exciting place to be for your field.

As for me, I've been working on developing integrated pest management strategies for a particularly nasty bacterial wilt affecting tomato crops in Florida. It's a challenge, but I love problem-solving and working with farmers to implement solutions.

I'm all for a catch-up call! How about Sunday afternoon, around 3 PM EST? Let me know if that works for you.

Looking forward to our chat,

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer 
selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.  Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.  
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your
thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend
johnny.
pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!

Hi Robert,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to let you know that I've just submitted our paper, ""Reassessing the Migration Patterns of Early Hominids,"" to the Journal of Human Evolution. Fingers crossed that it gets accepted!

In the meantime, I've been looking over the schedule for the upcoming conference in Paris. Our presentation is scheduled for the second day, right after the keynote speech. It's a great spot, and I think it will give our research a lot of exposure.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions for our presentation. I'm happy to take the lead on the slides, but I'd love your input as well.

Best,

Jennifer,
After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha 
Siegel, we discovered the following:

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point.  Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact?  Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?  

Thanks.

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.
good holidays,

Subject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Maria,

That's great that you have some connections with local artists! I'll also start reaching out to some contacts I have in the music community to see if they'd be interested in participating. 

The local library or community center sounds like a perfect venue for the exhibition. Thanks for taking the lead on coordinating that! I'll be happy to assist in any way I can. 

Next Tuesday at 4pm works great for me. I'll look out for the Zoom link. 

In the meantime, I'll start brainstorming some ideas for the art projects and how we can tie them into our lesson plans. I'm thinking we could have each class choose a different culture and musical genre to focus on, and then have them create a piece of art that represents their interpretation of that culture and music. 

What do you think? Let me know if you have any other ideas!

Hi Sanjay,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I'm currently working on a lesson plan about the human impacts of climate change, and I think your expertise on the Kashmir conflict could provide valuable insights for my students.

I was wondering if you could spare some time to discuss how the political tensions and conflicts in the region have affected environmental conservation efforts and resource management in Kashmir. I believe that including this perspective would give my students a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between geopolitics and environmental issues.

If you're willing to share your insights, I would be immensely grateful. Perhaps we could meet for coffee sometime next week to discuss this further?

Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Subject: RE: Request for collaboration on lesson plan about human impacts of climate change

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm delighted to hear that you found my research interesting and relevant to your lesson plan. I'm always eager to collaborate with educators who are passionate about helping students understand the complex relationships between human activities and the environment.

I would be more than happy to assist you in incorporating historical examples from 19th-century England into your lesson plan on the human impacts of climate change. The parallels between the environmental and social challenges faced during the industrial revolution and those we face today are striking, and I believe that exploring these connections can provide valuable insights for your students.

If you'd like, we could arrange a call or video conference to discuss your lesson plan in more detail and brainstorm ways to effectively integrate the historical context. I can also provide you with some additional resources, such as primary sources, scholarly articles, and excerpts from Dickens' works that could help bring the subject to life for your students.

Please let me know your availability for a discussion, and we can take it from there. I'm excited to work with you on this project and contribute to creating a meaningful learning experience for your students.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological 
$4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next 
sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with 
williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of 
the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common 
here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe 
in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some 
shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were 
trying to break $5.",corporate,No

Subject: Interdisciplinary Research Grant

Tom,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about the new interdisciplinary research grant that was announced last week. I think our work on the American and French Revolutions could be a great fit for this opportunity. What do you think about submitting a proposal together?

I was thinking we could explore the impact of Enlightenment ideas on the political systems that emerged in the wake of these revolutions, particularly in the United States. We could compare the U.S. Constitution to the various French revolutionary constitutions and analyze how they reflected (or didn't reflect) the principles of popular sovereignty, natural rights, and separation of powers.

Let me know if you're interested, and we can start brainstorming a more detailed proposal. I'm free to meet next week to discuss this further.

Hi John,

Thank you for the warm welcome. I'm excited to work with you and your team to optimize your boiler water treatment process. After reviewing the data and samples collected during my site visit, I've put together a proposal outlining our recommended solutions to address the scaling and corrosion issues.

Please find the proposal attached for your review. It includes a detailed analysis of your current system, our proposed modifications, and the expected outcomes. We believe these changes will significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of your water treatment process.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding the proposal. I'm happy to discuss the details further and make any necessary adjustments.

Looking forward to your feedback and the opportunity to work together on this project.

I'm glad you agree with the presentation structure! The infographics and quotes you mentioned will definitely make our findings more engaging and memorable for the audience.

Your points about aligning gamification with learning objectives and assessing impact are spot-on. I think we should also emphasize the importance of iteration and refinement based on student feedback and performance data.

I'll create an outline for the practical recommendations section and send it your way for feedback.

As for Tokyo, I've been researching some great restaurants and activities! I found a highly-rated sushi place near our hotel that I think we should try. It's called Sukiyabashi Jiro, and it's supposed to have the best tuna in the city. I'll make a reservation for us.

Hi Emily,

Thanks for the update. I'll review the project description and budget this afternoon and send you my comments by tomorrow.

For the Mexican archives, I agree that the AGN is essential. I also think we should try to visit the Archivo Histórico de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores in Mexico City, as it has a lot of material on diplomatic relations between Texas and Mexico in the 19th century.

I'm a bit concerned about the time constraints of our proposed trip. With the amount of material we want to consult, I think we might need to extend our stay or plan a second trip. What do you think?

Your insights on the semantics of environmental discourse would be invaluable to our project. I agree that analyzing the language used in our packaging campaign could help us optimize its effectiveness in encouraging responsible consumer behavior.

I would love to co-author a research paper or blog post with you, as it would be a great opportunity to combine our expertise and reach a wider audience. Perhaps we could start by exchanging some preliminary ideas and data related to our respective fields.

I look forward to meeting you at the conference and attending your presentation. I will be presenting on ""The Role of Packaging in Reducing Plastic Pollution"" on the second day of the conference, and I would be honored if you could attend.

I'm thrilled to have you on board for this project! Your enthusiasm and expertise will be invaluable in unlocking the secrets of this ancient fish weir.

Subject: RE: Interested in learning Arabic

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out, and it's a pleasure to meet a fellow history enthusiast! I'm thrilled to hear about your interest in learning Arabic and its rich history.

Given your background and interests, I would recommend starting with a solid foundation in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), as it will provide you with a broad understanding of the language and its structure. From there, you can explore more specialized resources focusing on the history of Arabic manuscripts and their preservation.

I suggest beginning with my beginner's course on ArabicforBeginners.com, which covers the essentials of MSA. Additionally, I recommend the following resources for your specific interests:

1. ""The Book of Books: A History of Arabic Manuscripts"" by Yasin Hamid Safadi
2. ""The Islamic Manuscript Tradition: Ten Centuries of Book Production"" by Christiane Gruber
3. The Islamic Manuscript Association (TIMA) website: www.islamicmanuscript.org

I would be happy to provide more personalized guidance as you progress in your learning journey. Feel free to reach out anytime with questions or for further recommendations.

Your interest in exploring the parallels between the preservation of knowledge during the American Civil War and in the Arabic-speaking world during historical conflicts is fascinating. I would be delighted to collaborate on such a project, as it would offer a unique perspective on the cultural and historical significance of manuscript preservation.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further. I look forward to supporting your Arabic learning experience and potential collaboration.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I've been struggling lately with a group of students who seem to lack motivation and discipline. I was wondering if you had any tips or strategies for engaging students and helping them develop essential life skills through sports. I know you've had success in this area, and I would greatly appreciate any insights you can share.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Hi Olivia,

Thanks for your email and for sharing the promising results of your refined therapy protocol. I completely agree that a collaboration could yield some fascinating insights and potentially lead to more effective treatments for joint pain.

I've been thinking about how we might design a study, and I think a good starting point would be to investigate the effects of polarized light on the expression of specific inflammatory markers in joint tissue samples. We could compare the results to those from your patient data to see if there's a correlation.

I'm happy to take the lead on the lab work if you can provide the patient samples and data. We could then work together to analyze the results and co-author a paper on our findings.

Does this sound like a good plan to you? I'm happy to discuss the details further on our call next Tuesday. Let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to working together on this exciting project!

Best regards,
Ethan",research,No

Hello

I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in
Houston.  We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is
beginning to flow.   On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the
signed contract is ""on the way"".

The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to
provide/supply natural gas to our company.  We consume quite a bit of
natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace.   I believe last
year we spent about $500,000.

As we both know the price of natural gas is rising.  It never hurts to check
and see if better deals are out there.  If this is of any interest, please
pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle.  The can contact
me first and then I will turn over to our person here.  Thanks

I completely agree with your assessment. Writing a joint letter or op-ed is a great idea. We could highlight the potential environmental risks and the need for transparent impact assessments and regulation.

I'm happy to take the lead on drafting the letter if you'd like. We could then review and refine it together before sending it out.

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20

two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=

create a=20

page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M =20


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20

Hey Emily,

I hope you're doing well! I came across this case study on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that I thought you might find interesting. It discusses the anatomical changes in the lung tissue and how they relate to the disease's progression. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the physiological mechanisms behind these changes.

Would you be interested in discussing this further? Maybe we could even write a brief article for our respiratory health group?

Jeff,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Jennifer,
I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard 
to Universal Studios.  He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in 
the range their group would consider for a prospect.  Lee said their main 
clients are chemical companies/producers.  He mentioned a typical usage would 
be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and  5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large 
users.  

I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for 
us.  I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something 
through Alan Engberg beginning next year.

I'm really excited about this presentation as well. I think we've learned so much on this journey, and it will be great to share that with our colleagues. Plus, it's always fun to brag about our students a bit, right? ;)

Dear Dr. Martinez,

I hope this email finds you well. I was wondering if you had any internship or research opportunities available for high school students at your facility. My daughter, Lily, is a junior in high school and has shown a keen interest in marine biology, particularly after learning about your work with nautiluses.

Lily has been an exceptional student, maintaining a 4.0 GPA while participating in various extracurricular activities, including the environmental club and science Olympiad. She is a dedicated and curious learner, and I believe she would be a valuable asset to your team.

If you have any openings or know of any programs that might suit her interests and skills, I would greatly appreciate your guidance. Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you would like to speak with Lily directly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Lucas,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we connected at the Digital Rights Conference in Amsterdam, and I've been following your work with the UN on children's rights in the digital age with great interest.

I'm reaching out to you today because I'm working on a new initiative that I believe could benefit from your expertise. We're developing a set of international guidelines for online safety education in schools, with the goal of creating a global standard for teaching children and young people about digital literacy and online safety.

Given your extensive knowledge of international human rights law and your work with the UN, I would be incredibly grateful for your insights and advice on how we can ensure that these guidelines are legally sound and aligned with global human rights principles. I believe that your input could be invaluable in making sure that our guidelines are not only effective but also respect the rights of children around the world.

Would you be open to discussing this initiative further and potentially collaborating on it? I would be happy to share more details about our plans and hear your thoughts on how we can work together to create a resource that can make a real difference in protecting children's rights and well-being in the digital age.

I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully working together on this important project.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Jordan,

That's great news about submitting our paper! I'm thrilled that we're one step closer to sharing our research with the wider meteorological community. I completely agree that we should start preparing for the International Meteorological Conference. It would be an incredible opportunity to showcase our work and get input from experts in the field.

I think for our presentation, we should definitely highlight the novel aspects of our approach and the potential for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts. We could also discuss some of the challenges we faced during the research process and how we overcame them.

On another note, I've been giving some thought to the future of our project, especially in light of the potential budget cuts at the national weather service. I'm worried that our research might be in jeopardy if we don't secure additional funding. Have you had any luck exploring alternative sources of support?

Let me know if you want to brainstorm some ideas or if there's anything I can do to help.

Hi Alex,

Thanks for sending over the final chapter! I've had a chance to read through it, and I must say, you've done an incredible job. The way you've explained the theropod family tree is both informative and engaging. I think young readers will love it.

I've also taken a look at the reference images you provided for the illustrations. I have a few ideas in mind that I think will really bring this chapter to life visually. I'll send you some rough sketches in the next couple of days for your feedback.

On another note, I've been thinking about our discussion regarding potential publishers. I did some research and found a few more that might be a good fit for our book. I've compiled a list with some notes on each one. Let me know if you want to take a look and discuss further.

Inviting our collaborators and community partners to join us at the award ceremony is an excellent idea. I'll start reaching out to them and coordinating with the event organizers to ensure they can attend.

I've also been thinking about how we can leverage this award to raise awareness and secure more funding for our future projects. Perhaps we could write a press release or an op-ed piece for the local newspaper to highlight the importance of environmental conservation and our ongoing efforts.

See you on Tuesday!

Hi Emily,

Thank you so much for the detailed information and resources on MMT! I really appreciate you taking the time to share your knowledge and experiences.

GeoGebra sounds like a fantastic tool for creating and manipulating mathematical models. I'm excited to explore it further and start incorporating it into my lesson plans. The sample lesson plans you attached are incredibly helpful and will give me a great starting point.

I love the idea of having students work in small groups or pairs to create and analyze their models. It's such a powerful way to foster collaboration, communication, and critical thinking skills. I can see how presenting their findings to the class would be an excellent opportunity for formative assessment and peer feedback.

I will definitely keep you posted on how it goes when I implement MMT in my classroom. I'm planning to start with a simple projectile motion problem and gradually build up to more complex scenarios. I'm curious to see how my students respond to this approach and how it impacts their understanding and problem-solving skills.

Thank you again for sharing this exciting strategy with me. I'm so grateful to have a colleague like you to learn from and collaborate with. Let's definitely keep in touch and continue to share our experiences and ideas.

Hi Jamie,

It's great to hear from you! I'm happy to help in any way I can. Patient assessment and documentation can be challenging, especially in complex cases. Here are a few resources and strategies that might be helpful:

1. [The SBAR Technique](https://www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/Tools/SBARToolkit.aspx) - This is a standardized approach to communication that can help you organize your thoughts and present information clearly.

2. [The SOAP Note Format](https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2015/0900/p30.html) - This is a common format for documenting patient encounters, which can help you ensure you're capturing all the necessary information.

3. [The PEWS Scale](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5418848/) - This is a tool that can help you assess a patient's condition and identify potential deterioration.

If you'd like, I'd be happy to take a look at your documentation and provide some feedback. Just send it over whenever you're ready.

I hope these resources are helpful, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions.

Hi John,

Thanks for sharing this! I hadn't heard of the SuperAccurate ADC before, but it sounds like it could be a game-changer for our project. I did a quick search online and found some impressive specs on their website. It seems like it could really help us achieve the level of accuracy we've been aiming for.

I think we should definitely give it a try. Do you want to order a few samples and test them out in your lab? I can work on updating the PCB design to accommodate the new component.

Also, I've been thinking more about the idea of presenting our project at the Electronics Expo next month. I think it would be a great opportunity to get some feedback from other professionals and potentially find collaborators for future projects. What do you think?

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Subject: RE: Zoo field trip advice

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! It's a pleasure to meet you, and I'm happy to help with your zoo field trip.

I think focusing on the diets of the animals is a great way to make the trip both educational and engaging for your students. One aspect you could highlight is how the zoo works to replicate the natural diets of the animals as closely as possible to support their health and well-being.

For example, did you know that many zoos have dedicated nutritionists on staff who work to create balanced diets for each species? They take into account factors like the animals' natural habitat, activity levels, and life stage when determining what to feed them.

If you're able to arrange it, a behind-the-scenes tour of the zoo's food preparation facilities could be a fascinating addition to your trip. Seeing the care and attention that goes into preparing the animals' meals might help your students appreciate the importance of a balanced diet for all living things.

I recently attended a conference where I heard a presentation on the role of nutrition in animal behavior and welfare. The researchers found that animals who are fed a diet that closely mimics what they would eat in the wild exhibit more natural behaviors and have better overall health outcomes. I can send you the conference proceedings if you're interested in learning more.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help make your field trip a success. I'm happy to brainstorm further ideas or provide additional resources.

Phillip,

I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are
getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a
message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems
because we are planning to also include some of your ""easy"" problems in the
simulation.

We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four
scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes
up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them.

We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your
help, and have a great weekend.
Mery

Emily,

You're very welcome! I'm confident that your students will respond well to those strategies. Please do keep me posted on how it goes – I'm always eager to hear about the successes (and challenges!) of fellow educators.

And I absolutely agree – let's keep the collaboration going! It's so valuable to have a network of colleagues to bounce ideas off of and learn from. I'll definitely reach out if I'm ever in need of some chemistry teaching wisdom.

Take care, and best of luck with your equilibrium unit!

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally ""False""


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

Subject: RE: Help with physical science homework?

Hi Jordan,

I'm glad to hear the visual aids were helpful! The periodic table is organized based on the number of protons (also known as the atomic number) in each element. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, with the elements with similar properties being placed in the same column (called a group).

Think of it like this: if our cells were arranged based on the number of organelles they contained, and cells with similar functions were grouped together, it would be a bit like the periodic table. The elements in each group have similar properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which determines how they interact with other elements.

I hope this helps clarify things! Remember, understanding the periodic table is a key part of understanding chemistry. Keep up the good work and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions.

Best,

Thank you for bringing this up. I can understand your concerns about the potential awkwardness within the group. However, I've already made significant progress on my own proposal, which focuses on a different aspect of early galaxy formation than our collaborative work.

I think it would be best if we each submitted our own proposals, highlighting our individual contributions and ideas. I'm confident that the review panel will be able to recognize the merit of both proposals, even if they are in the same general field.

I hope this doesn't negatively impact our collaboration on the JWST data analysis. I still believe we can produce an excellent paper together.

Jeff:
Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.

Subject: Seeking some advice from a seasoned educator

Hey Jordan,

I hope you're having a great week so far. I wanted to reach out because I've been giving some serious thought to a career change. As much as I love my work in paleontology, I can't help but feel a pull towards teaching, especially after our last book club discussion about the importance of science education.

I know you've been teaching English at Riverdale High for a while now, and I was wondering if you'd be open to chatting about your experience and any advice you might have for someone considering a similar path. I'm particularly interested in teaching science at the high school level, and of course, I'd love to hear more about your perspective on working with teenagers.

Let me know if you have any free time in the coming weeks to grab a coffee or, even better, go on that hike we've been talking about for months!

Best,
Emily",research,No

Don't even think you're getting out of this with the ""for a while"" crap.  
Just for that you can add a star to the place we're going.

Phillip;

This attachment is my start on your 1031 search.  From my experience, you
will probably need to park the money until we find the right investment for
you.  I have not had time to analize all of the possibilities.

Are you coming on Friday? Do you want me to drive by these properties
tomorrow, or are we going to do it Friday?

Please reply

Hey Samir,

I hope you're doing well! I recently published a blog post about the history of Usenet and thought you might find it interesting. I included some information about modern Usenet service providers and how they've made this classic technology more accessible to a wider audience.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the article and if you think Usenet could be a useful tool for your students. I'm also curious to learn more about the types of interactive content you're looking to incorporate into your social skills curriculum.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to brainstorm some ideas together!

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Phillip

Michelle,

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the ""Utility Lines"".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I have sent Mike B. a copy of this email.

Thank you,

Phillip

Subject: RE: Theropod dentition project update

Emily,

This is incredible! Your findings align perfectly with some of the morphological data I've been analyzing. It seems that this species had a more complex jaw musculature than other theropods, which could have allowed it to generate the necessary force to process tough plant material.

I agree that we need to move quickly to get our paper published. I'll start working on the manuscript and will send you a draft by the end of the week. In the meantime, could you work on refining the dental tissue analysis and preparing some high-quality images for the figures?

I also think we should reach out to Dr. Olivia Chen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. She has some expertise in this area and might be able to provide some valuable insights. Plus, having her as a co-author could give our paper more credibility and increase our chances of getting published in a top-tier journal.

Let's touch base on Friday to discuss our progress and strategize our next steps. I'm happy to book a video call if you prefer.

It will be more impactful to show the collaboration between our organizations and highlight the combined efforts that went into this project.

I was also thinking, once the project is launched and we've presented at the conference, it might be a good idea to write a paper on our work for a peer-reviewed journal. What do you think?

I will definitely attend your presentation on ""The Role of Packaging in Reducing Plastic Pollution."" It sounds like a fascinating topic, and I'm eager to learn more about your work.

I note that Sandra Brawner is managing this product today, but your ID had it 
Friday night.

Does this sound right?

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA 
financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to 
you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still 
attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Jennifer,
Due to the Vivendi merger, the Universal deal has taken on a whole new 
scope.  On a lead from Jeff Y., I contacted Kim Monk, Dr. Corp. Alliances, 
who reports to Nebergall.  Kim was interested in discussing this further and 
working on best leveraging BU strategies.  We are to catch up when she 
returns to Houston, but this is what we discussed in our quick phone call 
today:

Vivendi 
Enron delivered an MOU to Vivendi (Kim may forward)
Currently 5-6 initiatives including:
Vivendi overall - bandwidth, co-location, dark fiber, PAN European network, 
cable 
Havas (Viviendi subsidiary) - discussions with Havas CEO for distance 
learning, bandwidth, ASP and streaming initiatives
Initiatives in other subsidiaries including:  Canal Plus, Digitel

Blockbuster
Due to restructuring of Vivendi/Universal, EBS to work on Blockbuster's 
year-end (Phase I) initiatives first and then (Phase II & III) 3Q next year
Cox speaking with Universal in LA as content and distribution partner 
(although this is Blockbuster's obligation, Enron is also working as a third 
party to secure)

Enron-Vivendi Relationship
Vivendi sees Enron as both a competitor and partner depending upon the segment",corporate,No

That coffee shop sounds perfect! I've heard great things about their eco-friendly practices. Wednesday afternoon works well for me, too. Let's say 2 PM?

I'm really excited to discuss our respective projects and see if there might be some synergy between them. With your grassroots approach and my policy-focused work, I think we could make a real impact in our city.

See you on Wednesday!

Hi Alex,

A hiking trip sounds like a great idea! I'm always eager to explore the natural world and see the geological features we're studying up close. It would be a nice break from the office and could definitely help inform our work.

As for the project, I think reaching out to urban planners and emergency services is a great idea. I can start putting together a list of potential contacts and draft some emails to see if they'd be interested in collaborating with us.

I'm also happy to set up a meeting for early next week to discuss our next steps and start putting together some preliminary maps. I'll send out a calendar invite and book a conference room.

I'm really excited about the direction this project is going and can't wait to see what we can accomplish together!

Best,

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?

 

I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?

Subject: RE: Seeking gardening advice for student project

Dear Emily,

It's great to hear from you, and I'm more than happy to help with your students' project. I think it's fantastic that they're combining coding and computational thinking with sustainable gardening. It's a wonderful opportunity for them to apply their skills to a real-world problem.

I'd be delighted to share my knowledge of gardening in our specific climate zone and provide guidance on their garden layouts and planting schedules. I believe this project has the potential to not only educate your students but also promote eco-friendly practices in our community.

If you're interested, I could come to your classroom to give a brief presentation on the basics of gardening in Hardiness Zone 8 and answer any questions your students might have. I could also provide resources and support throughout the project.

Additionally, I've been thinking about ways to expand this initiative. What if we collaborate on a grant proposal to secure funding for a school-community garden project? The project could aim to educate students and community members about sustainable gardening practices while providing fresh produce to local food banks and shelters. I'd be happy to discuss this idea further with you.

Please let me know when would be a good time to discuss this project in more detail. I'm excited to work with you and your students on this wonderful initiative.

Subject: Implementing new language assessment framework

Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since we last touched base, but I was hoping to pick your brain about something. I'm considering implementing a new language assessment framework in my Swedish language and culture course, and I remember you mentioning that you had successfully implemented a similar framework in your English courses. I was wondering if you could share some insights on the implementation process and any challenges you encountered along the way.

I'd also like to discuss the upcoming guest lecture you'll be giving at our university. I think it would be great if you could touch on the topic of language assessment frameworks during your talk, as it's a subject of growing interest among our faculty.

Lastly, I wanted to bring up the research project we're working on together. I've made some progress on my end and would love to hear about any developments from your side. We should start thinking about how we want to present our findings at the next conference.

I hope you're doing well and that we can catch up soon. Let me know when would be a good time for a call or video chat.

Dear Yumi,

It was a pleasure meeting you at the International Conference on Japanese Art and Culture last week. I enjoyed our conversation about the cultural significance of motifs in Japanese art, and I believe your expertise in traditional Japanese textiles could be invaluable for a project I'm currently working on.

I'm in the process of curating an exhibition focusing on the Meiji period and the cultural significance of motifs in Japanese art. I would love to learn more about your work with traditional textiles from that era and explore the possibility of collaborating on this project.

Would you be available for a call next week to discuss this further? I look forward to hearing from you.

I would like to achieve a yield of 5%.  I am expecting an average maturity date of 2020.  

Since the treasury is only paying 6.25% taxable at 39%, isn't the effective yield only 3.8%?  Why wouldn't I move this money to muni's?

Phillip,

Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
$785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due on Jan
31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worry
about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value of
your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottom
line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep in
mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close that
position you will probably get put those.

Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, if
there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such
as duration, maturity, etc.

Steve

If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

I've reviewed the updated outline and I think it's shaping up very well. I've added some additional sections on the current state of space debris, the limitations of existing mitigation guidelines, and the potential role of commercial space companies in debris removal efforts. Please let me know what you think.

I've also done some preliminary research on existing international agreements and legal frameworks related to space activities. It looks like there may be some opportunities to build on and expand the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention in our proposal.

You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you

the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

Hey Lucas,

I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to share some of the photos I took during our amazing hiking trip to Sedona last weekend. Here's a link to the album: https://www.photostock.com/sedona-adventure

I can't believe how stunning the red rocks and desert landscapes are. It's so different from the forests and lakes in Sweden, but equally breathtaking. I'm thinking of using some of these photos in my upcoming Swedish culture course to show the diversity of natural environments in different parts of the world.

How's your research on desert ecosystems going? I remember you mentioned some interesting findings about the impact of climate change on the vegetation in Sedona. I'd love to learn more about it.

Let's plan our next hiking adventure soon! Maybe we can explore the Superstition Mountains next time.

Take care,

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the 
deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on 
the deal.  
Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical 
deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

Hunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,
We have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. 
For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. 
Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. 
OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. 
The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. 
This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.
The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.

Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the 
detailed worksheet that you mentioned.

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones 
granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of 
restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be 
kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have 
fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

Thank you for looking into this issue.

Hey freak-o!  How have you been?  I'm just taking a study break (finals,

Hi Robert,

I hope you're doing well. I've been looking over our outline for the conference paper, and I think we have a solid foundation to build upon. I was wondering if you had a chance to delve into the symbolism of the character Benjy in ""The Sound and the Fury""? I believe his narrative provides a unique perspective on the themes we're discussing.

Let me know your thoughts, and we can schedule a meeting to discuss our progress further.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

Michael,

Thank you so much for your email and for your willingness to collaborate on this series! I'm thrilled to have your expertise and insights.

I love your idea of focusing on the cultural significance of certain bird species in North American history. That's a fascinating angle that I hadn't considered before. I think it could add a lot of depth and context to the series.

And I would be honored if you would write a guest post for my blog! I think it's a great idea to introduce the topic and get readers excited about the series. I'm open to any ideas you have for the post, and I'm happy to provide any support or resources you need.

I'm also wondering if you might be interested in collaborating on a series of educational videos about bird watching and its historical context. I think it could be a great way to reach a wider audience and engage people in a different way. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in exploring!

Thank you again for your willingness to collaborate. I'm really looking forward to working with you and learning from your expertise.

Best,

Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant
contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form
#OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to
close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.

     Phillip,

     I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you
     closed?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems
     above or around the garage area to consider.

     If you find something and it's faxable, please send  it to my fax at

Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Subject: New theropod fossils - your input needed!

Hi Laura,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you because I recently acquired some fascinating new fossil samples that I think could shed light on the evolution of the Allosauroidea group of theropods. The fossils appear to show some unique anatomical features that I haven't seen before, and I'd love to get your thoughts on their potential implications.

Would you be available for a video call next week to discuss these fossils in more detail? I'm hoping to get your expert opinion on how they might fit into our current understanding of allosauroid evolution and what further analyses we might want to pursue.

Please let me know if you have any availability next week, and we can set something up. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these exciting new finds!

Subject: RE: Exciting new theropod discovery!

Liam,

I'm so glad you're on board with this project! I'll send over the preliminary data and photographs of the fossil specimens later today. I've also been giving some thought to the phylogenetic implications, and I think you'll find the results surprising.

Based on the unique features of this fossil, I believe it may challenge some of our current assumptions about theropod diversification during the Cretaceous. It could potentially represent a new clade or subfamily, which would have significant implications for our understanding of theropod evolution.

I'm curious to hear your initial thoughts once you've had a chance to review the data. We can then schedule a call to discuss our strategy for the paper and how we want to present our findings.

Thanks again for your collaboration on this project. I have a feeling it's going to be a game-changer!

Thank you for reaching out and for the project overview. I am intrigued by your research and can see how my knowledge of linguistics could potentially apply to understanding non-verbal communication in spiders. However, I must apologize for the late response, as I have been dealing with some personal matters and an impending deadline for my book.

I would love to discuss this further and explore how we can collaborate, but I am not sure when I will be able to devote the necessary time and attention to your project. I don't want to commit to something I can't fully invest in at the moment.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this in more detail? I am happy to provide feedback on your project overview and share some initial thoughts, but I want to be upfront about my current constraints.

Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the 
detailed worksheet that you mentioned.

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones 
granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of 
restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be 
kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have

Hi Oliver,

Fantastic news about your flight bookings! It's going to be such a productive week. I'm glad you like the plan for the retreat. I'll send you the Airbnb details once I have them.

Thanks for the update on your progress with the British slang data. I'm eager to see what you've found! I've been working on a similar compilation for American slang terms, focusing on regional variations and how they've evolved over time. I'll send you my draft by the end of the week as well.

In the meantime, I've been thinking about how we might structure our paper. I think it would be interesting to start with an overview of the history of slang in both American and British English, then dive into our specific findings and analysis. What do you think? 

I'll also create a shared Google Doc for us to collaborate on the paper during the retreat. That way, we can both access it easily and make edits in real-time.

Looking forward to catching up and working together in person!

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

David,

Wednesday at 2 pm works perfectly for me. I'll see you in your office then. I'll come prepared with some research questions and sources to kick off our discussion.

I'm looking forward to our collaboration as well. I have a feeling this project will be both challenging and rewarding.

Alex,

Thank you for your email and for the great work you've done on the website. The new page looks fantastic and provides all the necessary information for potential attendees and sponsors.

I've already reached out to a few colleagues who expressed interest in supporting our cause. I'll keep you posted on any updates regarding sponsorships.

I also have a suggestion for the website: could we add a section about the importance of cardiovascular health and how it relates to the medical equipment we're fundraising for? I think it would be a great way to educate our community and emphasize the significance of our event.

Please let me know if you need any help with the content for this section. I'd be happy to provide some input based on my experience.

Best,

I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday.  I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible.  

Sorry to hear about your wife's condition.  She will be in our prayers.

Thank you for your kind words and the invitation to speak at the ""Mathematical Models for Environmental Sustainability"" seminar. I am honored to be considered and would be delighted to participate.

Your organization's mission resonates with me, and I believe that applying mathematical models to environmental issues is crucial for finding sustainable solutions. I would be happy to present my research and engage in discussions with the attendees.

The proposed date of October 15th works well with my schedule. Please let me know the specific time slot you have in mind for my presentation and any other details regarding the event, such as the expected audience size and any technical requirements for the presentation.

I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important seminar and look forward to working with you and the Environmental Sustainability Alliance.

I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great

tickets.  

I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket!

Thank you so much for your suggestions and ideas! The topics and activities you mentioned are perfect and I will definitely incorporate them into the podcast episode. 

I would be absolutely thrilled to be a guest speaker at your professional development workshop! It's such an honor to be asked and I'm excited to have the opportunity to share my passion for astronomy with other educators. Please let me know the details and how I can prepare.

I've been thinking, since we both have a common interest in science education, would you be interested in collaborating on creating a set of astronomy lesson plans and activities that can be used in primary school classrooms? We could share these resources with other educators through a website or blog. What do you think?

I look forward to discussing this further and working together to make astronomy more accessible and engaging for students.

Hi Alex,

That's fantastic! I'm so excited to hear about your research project. It sounds like a valuable contribution to the field, and I'm eager to learn more about the lesser-known female geneticists you've been studying.

How about we meet on Wednesday, May 18th at 3 pm? There's a great coffee shop near the conference center called ""The Brewed Awakening."" I'll be wearing a blue blouse with a silver pendant necklace, so I should be easy to spot.

I've been considering writing a book about the history of genetics and was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on the project. Your research would be a perfect fit, and I think it could be a great opportunity for both of us.

Let me know if the meeting time and location work for you, and if you're interested in discussing the book collaboration further.

Subject: RE: Language Arts Conference

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the email! I'm definitely excited about the conference and think the session on drama techniques sounds perfect for our project. I'll make sure to mark it down on our schedule.

I took a quick look at the ReadWriteThink website and it seems like a goldmine of resources! I appreciate you sharing it with me. I'll dive deeper into it this weekend and let you know if I find any particularly useful lesson plans or activities.

On a related note, I was thinking about our curriculum development project and how we can incorporate more culturally responsive teaching practices to better support our English language learners. I'd love to brainstorm some ideas with you sometime next week, perhaps over a virtual coffee chat?

Looking forward to the conference and continuing our collaboration!

Best,
Michael",research,No

Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our discussion on the intersection of the heliocentric theory and the Scientific Revolution, and I believe we have a compelling topic for our joint presentation at the upcoming conference.

As we've previously discussed, I'll focus on the development of the heliocentric theory and its conflicts with the Catholic Church, while you'll explore the role of Renaissance scientists in the Scientific Revolution. Together, we can create a cohesive narrative that highlights the significance of these events in shaping the relationship between science and religion.

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal and if you have any suggestions for improving it. I'd be happy to collaborate on the abstract and outline for our presentation.

Looking forward to your response and working together on this exciting project!

Dear Professor Nakamura,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we've been collaborating on the research project exploring the influence of early Japanese history on Meiji-era art for the past year. I'm now in the process of organizing an exhibition featuring Meiji-era art at the Kyoto Museum, and I was wondering if you would be interested in contributing an essay to the exhibition catalog.

Your expertise in early Japanese history would be invaluable in providing context for the artworks and helping our visitors better understand the cultural significance of the Meiji period. The essay would need to be around 2,000 words and submitted by the end of next month.

Please let me know if you would be willing to contribute and if you have any questions about the project.

Frank:
One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""
Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's"" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Randy,

Why is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?  Were these positions created in the last week or so?  Can you print a forwards detail and move these deals into FT-PGE?  Do not just transfer at mid market.  Please move the deals.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee

Maria,

I'm glad you're on board with this project! It's a great opportunity to showcase our museum's exhibits and educational programs. I think combining our expertise in history and science will create a truly engaging experience for visitors of all ages.

I'm available to meet next Tuesday, April 18th, at 10 am. We could meet in the museum's conference room to discuss our ideas and plan our next steps. I'll bring some initial concepts for the interactive component, and we can brainstorm together.

Also, don't forget about the special event we're planning to showcase our new exhibits and programs. We should start thinking about how to promote it and ensure its success. Perhaps we could create some engaging content that combines history and science to appeal to both adults and children.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best,

Jeff, 

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Phillip

Dear Dr. Thompson,

I am happy to provide you with the high-resolution images for the promotional materials. I will go through my collection and select some of my best marine ecosystem photographs that I believe will complement your lecture series theme. I will send them to you by the end of next month, as requested.

Regarding the virtual component of the series, I would be more than happy to assist you with the technical setup and troubleshooting. As someone who frequently uses technology in my research and teaching, I understand the importance of a smooth and glitch-free presentation. I am glad to share my knowledge and experience with you.

Please let me know a few dates and times that work well for you in the coming weeks, and we can schedule a meeting to go over the technical requirements and ensure that everything is in place for the virtual component of the series. I am more than willing to help in any way I can.

Thank you once again for the opportunity to be a part of this fascinating lecture series. I am looking forward to our collaboration and to learning more about the religious and historical aspects of early America from your perspective.

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I have some exciting news to share. We've been invited to speak at the National Digital Literacy Conference in Washington D.C. next month! This is an incredible opportunity for us to showcase our work and connect with other experts in the field.

I think we should focus our presentation on the successful implementation of our program in the schools we've worked with so far, and our plans for expanding to other cities and states. We could also highlight the importance of collaboration between cybersecurity experts and educators in creating effective digital literacy initiatives.

Let me know your thoughts on this, and if you have any ideas for our presentation. We should also start looking into travel arrangements and lodging.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20

Dear Dr. Patel,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Dr. Evelyn Stewart, and I'm a paleontologist specializing in dinosaur biology and theropod evolution. I'll be one of your co-presenters at the upcoming science conference in Cusco, Peru.

The conference organizers have paired us together to give a joint presentation on the similarities between the extinction of dinosaurs and the current global fight against viral infections. I'm really excited about this interdisciplinary approach and the potential for sparking interesting discussions.

As the conference is being held at a high altitude, the organizers have recommended that we arrive a few days early to acclimate. I was wondering if you'd be interested in sharing a room to save on expenses and to get to know each other better before our presentation. Let me know what you think.

Looking forward to meeting you in person and working together on our presentation.

Hey Alex,

I hope you're doing well! I was thrilled to hear about your recent promotion at Tech Solutions. Congratulations!

I'm reaching out because I could use your expert advice. As you might remember, I'm working on my dissertation about William Faulkner's lesser-known works, and I've been granted the opportunity to travel to his hometown in Mississippi to conduct research. I'll have access to some incredible primary sources, but I'm worried about properly archiving and backing up the materials I'll be working with.

I know you're the go-to person for all things digital preservation, so I was hoping you could point me in the right direction. What software or tools do you recommend for archiving documents and notes while I'm on the road? I want to make sure I don't lose any valuable information during my trip.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer! I promise to return the favor with some Faulknerian insights once I'm back.

so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.
    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.
  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available? thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it 
bt
wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.
  have a good weekdn my man

i think you are done with hhd/cdd stuff -ie did you complete the cdds vs

demand?(combined)?, cdds vs total stock change??
 if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula

show you what i mean

then we start our price data base from bloom berg

check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw

Jennifer,

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I 
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to 
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's 
retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very 
""customer-focused"" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to 
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Not that it matters but wanted you to know:
BMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 % 
discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time.  He states now 
that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later 
date.

Importance: High

Jenny/Bob

Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing:

TidalSoft, Sysadmiral
Approx.  90 k  ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) 
We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k 
worst case.  This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are trying 
very hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our 
additional components at the current quote price if we signed.  

BMC, Control -M
Approx. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from 
the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for 
a total of 628 k

Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. 

We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take 
over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long 
term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP 
modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors 
into BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft 
(Larry if you have info on this please comment).

Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning 
towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  You 
guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it 
will lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% 
discount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn 
how over priced their products are !

Let me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through 
or be advised to let it go till the New Year.

Thanks
Bruce


*****
Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :
BMC, Control SA
1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for future 
consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate 
as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.   I guess they put 
this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback and edits on the presentation! I agree that the slides look great and the additional data points you added really strengthen our argument. I think we're in good shape for the conference.

Your suggested Q&A questions are spot-on. I'll add them to our prep document along with some potential responses. If you have any other questions that come to mind, please let me know.

I'm definitely interested in co-authoring a paper on our research! It would be a fantastic opportunity to share our findings and contribute to the field. I think a good first step would be to outline the structure and divide up the writing tasks as you suggested. Would you be available for a call next week to discuss this further and get the ball rolling?

I think your ideas for the grant applications are spot-on. Highlighting the significance of our research and its potential implications for contemporary debates is exactly the right approach. I'd be thrilled to collaborate with you on this - it's a great opportunity to build on the work we've already done together.

If you're willing to take the lead on drafting some of the key sections, I'd be happy to provide feedback and help with editing. We could aim to have a first draft ready by the end of the month, if that works with your schedule.

I'm really excited about this next phase of our collaboration. It's wonderful to have a partner who is not only brilliant but also a true pleasure to work with.

Dear Lena,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our recent discussions and the idea of creating a bilingual glossary of chemistry terms. I believe this project could be a great opportunity for both of us to combine our expertise and create something valuable.

As we have discussed, I will focus on the German translations and etymologies of the terms, while you will provide the scientific explanations and ensure the accuracy of the content.

I suggest we start by creating a list of the most common chemistry terms and their German equivalents. We can then work on the etymologies and explanations, and finally, organize the glossary in a clear and user-friendly manner.

Please let me know your thoughts on this project and if you have any suggestions for additional features or resources we could include.

As I was delving into the research, I couldn't help but think about our conversations at the book club and how your expertise in thermodynamics and power generation systems could provide valuable insights into my work.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating on this project. I believe that combining our knowledge in literature and engineering could lead to a fascinating exploration of the intersection between the humanities and STEM fields. Perhaps we could meet up to discuss the possibility of working together on a presentation for the conference?

Let me know your thoughts!

Subject: RE: Reconnecting after the sustainability conference

Hi Sarah,

It's great to hear from you! I've also been reflecting on our conversation and thinking about how my research could potentially apply to your snow leopard conservation project.

I've recently been studying the impact of cognitive biases like optimism bias and status quo bias on decision-making in environmental organizations. These biases can lead to underestimating the severity of environmental threats and resisting necessary changes to conservation strategies.

I'd be very interested in learning more about the specific challenges you're facing in your project and discussing how these biases might be playing a role. Perhaps we could explore ways to design interventions that account for these cognitive factors and promote more effective decision-making.

I'm available for a call next week. How about Tuesday afternoon, around 2 pm my time (EST)? Let me know if that works for you.

Looking forward to continuing our discussion!

Mike & Tony,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

I'll definitely be at the GSA conference in Salt Lake City, so let's definitely plan on meeting up. I'm free on the afternoon of the second day of the conference, if that works for you. We could grab lunch at the hotel restaurant and have a good chat about your research.

I'm curious to learn more about the statistical methods you've been using to analyze the fossil distribution patterns. It would be great if you could bring along any maps or diagrams that illustrate your key findings so far. I might be able to suggest some additional analytical techniques that could help you refine your interpretations.

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Subject: Seeking guidance on a historical Jewish ritual

Dear Rabbi Silverstein,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you from Jerusalem, where I am currently studying for a semester at the Hebrew University. As you know, I have been deeply immersed in the study of Jewish history and traditions, and I have encountered a question that I believe you may be able to help me with.

In my research, I have come across conflicting interpretations of the historical significance of the ritual of ""X."" Some scholars argue that it originated during the Second Temple period, while others claim that it dates back to the time of the Babylonian exile. As I delve deeper into this topic, I find myself unsure of which interpretation to trust.

I remember the many insightful discussions we had about Jewish rituals and their origins during my time at the JCC in Chicago, and I am hoping you might be able to shed some light on this matter. If you have any resources, insights, or guidance you could share with me, I would be immensely grateful.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and catching up on how things are going back in Chicago.

As for a sneak peek, I can share that our discovery revolves around the detection of a previously unknown population of galaxies in the early universe. These galaxies appear to be much more numerous and luminous than previously thought, challenging our current models of galaxy formation and evolution.

I'm attaching a figure that illustrates the unexpected luminosity function we've observed. I'd be interested to hear your initial thoughts on the implications of this finding for our understanding of the early universe.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Looks good.  I'm a little confused as to how many users can be on.  The 
system needs to be able to handle 50+ users at one time, each being able to 
post messages any time.

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

Hi Jordan,

I'm so glad you reached out! I've been thinking about our conversation non-stop since the conference. I'm really excited about the potential for our collaboration and can't wait to get started.

I'm free on Tuesday afternoon, so let's plan on chatting then. Do you want to meet in person or just have a phone call? Let me know what works best for you.

I've been doing some research on the latest advancements in 3D scanning technology and I think I have some ideas that could be really useful for your work. I'm also curious to learn more about your current research and how you think motion control systems could be applied.

Looking forward to our chat on Tuesday!

Subject: RE: New study on vaccine safety during pregnancy

Emily,

Thank you for sharing this study. It's great to have more evidence to support the safety and efficacy of the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy. I think we should definitely include this information in our patient education materials and discuss it during our counseling sessions.

Regarding the meeting with the hospital administration, I agree that we should go over the presentation together. I was thinking we could highlight the potential benefits of our initiative, such as increased vaccine uptake rates, reduced incidence of pertussis among infants, and improved overall maternal and infant health outcomes. We could also emphasize the potential cost savings associated with preventing vaccine-preventable diseases.

Let's schedule a time to meet and finalize our presentation. I'm available next Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning. Please let me know what works best for you.

Best,

Subject: Sports and Math Event Planning

Hey Emily,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, our school is planning a Sports and Math event for the students, and we've been asked to organize it. I think this is a great opportunity to showcase our collaboration and get the students excited about both subjects.

I was thinking we could have stations set up for different activities, like calculating the trajectory of a soccer ball, analyzing player statistics, and even having students participate in mini-games that incorporate math problems. What do you think?

Let's set up a meeting to brainstorm more ideas and start planning the event. I'm free this Friday after school if that works for you. Let me know!

Best regards,
John",research,No

period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis 
is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925.

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on community engagement challenges in CLTS project

Dear Rajesh,

Thank you so much for your thoughtful response and for sharing those valuable insights from your experience. The strategies you mentioned, particularly identifying local champions and conducting participatory workshops, resonate with me and align with the approach we've been trying to take. We will definitely incorporate the idea of providing small incentives for early adopters – that could be a game-changer in creating momentum within the community.

I would be incredibly grateful if you could connect me with the local NGO in Laos. Learning about their successful approach and hearing their stories could provide us with the inspiration and guidance we need to overcome the challenges we're facing.

And of course, any introductions you could facilitate with potential partners in Cambodia through your colleagues at UNICEF's regional office would be immensely appreciated. Collaborating with local organizations could help us tap into valuable local knowledge and resources that could make a real difference in our project's impact.

I will definitely keep you updated on our progress and will be sure to reach out if any other questions or ideas come up. Thank you again for your support and for being such a valuable resource in the WASH community. I hope we can continue to exchange ideas and perhaps even explore opportunities to collaborate on advancing WASH access in the future.

Best regards,
Emily

Hi Emily,

It's great to hear from you! Thanks for reaching out about this grant opportunity. The focus on innovative approaches to HIV vaccine development aligns perfectly with my current research direction.

I'd be more than happy to discuss your proposal further and provide any insights or suggestions I can. I'm fairly flexible next week, but Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning would work best for me. Let me know what time suits you, and we can set up a call.

Looking forward to catching up and exploring this opportunity together.

Best,

Carlos,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
Fees&Devel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Greg,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

Phillip",corporate,No

Subject: RE: Fascinating presentation at the conference!

Hi Olivia,

I've just finished reading the papers you sent over, and I'm impressed by the potential of radar technology for NEO detection. The sensitivity and resolution of modern radar systems are truly remarkable, and I can see how they could be a valuable tool in our efforts to monitor and track potentially hazardous asteroids.

I've also been thinking more about the implications of our research for planetary defense. If we can develop a reliable radar-based system for detecting and tracking NEOs, it could significantly improve our ability to predict and mitigate the risks posed by asteroid impacts. This could have a major impact on public policy and international cooperation in the field of space exploration and planetary protection.

I'm eager to continue our collaboration and explore the possibilities for a joint research project. I'm available for a call next week, anytime after 2 PM on Tuesday or Thursday. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to our continued partnership!

Best regards,

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.
good holidays,

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled to hear about your multicultural art project and would be delighted to collaborate with you and your students.

I believe that combining art, culture, and health is a powerful way to engage young minds and promote a deeper understanding of the world around us. I'd be happy to provide you with information on various traditional health practices and their cultural significance, which could serve as inspiration for your students' art pieces.

Additionally, I think it would be valuable to include a culinary aspect in the project, as food is often a central element in many cultural traditions. Students could create art pieces inspired by the traditional dishes of different communities, while also learning about the nutritional and health implications of these foods.

Please let me know your thoughts on this idea, and we can discuss further details on how to best integrate these concepts into your project.

The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics 
book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold 
longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market. 
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was 
transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until 
this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's 
position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

Dear Sarah,

Thank you so much for your prompt response and willingness to help. I greatly appreciate your support and expertise.

As for our project, we have been focusing on the following interventions:
1. Construction and rehabilitation of boreholes and wells to improve access to clean water
2. Promotion of household latrines and community sanitation facilities
3. Hygiene education campaigns, including handwashing and safe water storage practices

We have been implementing these interventions in 5 villages, reaching approximately 2,500 people. The initial results have been promising, with a significant reduction in waterborne diseases and improved sanitation practices.

However, we are now looking to expand our reach to 20 villages in the region, targeting around 10,000 people. Our main challenges are ensuring the sustainability of the interventions, securing funding, and building local capacity.

I would be grateful for any resources or insights you can share on these topics. A call to discuss this further would be extremely helpful.

Thank you once again for your support. I look forward to learning from your experience and expertise.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call

     Phillip,

     Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx.
     $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes due
     on Jan
     31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to
     worry
     about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value
     of
     your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the
     bottom
     line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep
     in
     mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close
     that
     position you will probably get put those.

     Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also,
     if
     there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your
     proposal such
     as duration, maturity, etc.

Good hearing from you.  Hope all is going well.  I gave your name to Per 
Sekse in our New York office.  He deals with a couple hedge funds we 
currently do business with and has addressed some of the obstacles that we 
face with other counterparties.  He is on vacation this week but will call 
next week.  If you have any problems or concerns, feel free to call.

Subject: Help with FAQ document

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, I've been working on a FAQ document for our intro programming course. I've made some good progress, but I've run into a few topics that I think could use your expertise.

Would you be willing to take a look at some of the questions I've compiled and provide your insights? I'd really appreciate your help in making sure the explanations are clear and accessible to students at all levels.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to help. Thanks in advance for your time and expertise!

Robert,

I'm so glad you're interested in the new artifact! I'll send over the data and my initial thoughts later this week. I really value your input and expertise.

I completely agree with your assessment of the situation with Dr. Müller and the French site. We should definitely proceed with caution, but I think the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Let's start working on the grant application and see where it takes us.

Your new hypothesis about the role of religion in the agricultural transition sounds fascinating. I'd love to hear more about it. Perhaps we can set up a video call next week to discuss both of our projects in more detail? Let me know what works for your schedule.

It's always a pleasure collaborating with you, Robert. I'm looking forward to our continued work together.

Lucy,

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Talk to you later,

Hi Priya,

It was wonderful to meet you at the Sustainable Space Exploration Conference last week. I really enjoyed our conversation about the intersection of space sustainability and scientific computing. Your work on developing a programming language tailored for space-related applications sounds fascinating!

I've been thinking about our discussion on promoting sustainable practices in our respective fields, and I believe there could be some interesting synergies between our work. I'm curious to learn more about the specific challenges you face when it comes to ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of scientific computing in space missions.

Would you be interested in scheduling a call to further explore potential collaborations or sharing of best practices? I'd be happy to provide more details about my research on space debris mitigation policies and how they might relate to your work.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

I believe that with the right resources and support, we can make a significant impact on our students' learning outcomes.

Please let me know your availability for next week, and we can set up a meeting to discuss the details. I am looking forward to working with you on this exciting project.

Jennifer, I'm not so territorial that fire hydrants and trees are on my 
priority list, but I thought that I was doing my job OK on this.  If I read 
Crowder's FWD to Kim in a certain ""tone"", it appears to me that they feel I 
am overstepping.  I'm sure there is a better way for me to coordinate and 
facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a ""tone"" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK? 

On a lighter note (I hope), I hope your NY trip went well, and I'll see you 
tomorrow!

Thank you,

Jeff

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a ""sell through/sell with"" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Hi Michael,

Thank you so much for your feedback on the drama-based activities! I appreciate your suggestions and have incorporated them into the final version.

Regarding the conference presentation, I think you're right that we should focus on the unique aspects of our curriculum. Perhaps we could start with an overview of the challenges we faced in teaching language arts and how we came up with the idea to develop this curriculum. Then, we can highlight a few key activities and scaffolding techniques that showcase our approach. We could even do a short demonstration of one of the drama-based activities if time allows.

What do you think? I'm open to any other ideas you might have.

Also, I wanted to share some exciting news. My principal has given me the green light to pilot our curriculum in my classroom next semester! I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to see it in action and gather feedback from students and parents.

I hope things are going well with your end of the curriculum development. Please keep me updated on your progress!

I love your idea for the presentation! A case study showcasing the challenges and successes of the project would be highly relevant and engaging for the conference audience. I'm confident that our collaboration and the concrete results we achieved will make for a compelling story.

I'm happy to collaborate on the abstract and proposal. How about we set up a call next week to brainstorm and divide up the tasks? I can send you a few potential time slots that work for me.

Also, I wanted to mention that I've been working on a side project related to using machine learning algorithms to improve radar data interpretation. I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on it when we chat.

Excited to work together again and see you at the conference!

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and

Hey David,

I hope you're having a great time in Africa and that your research is going well. I can't wait to hear all about it when you get back.

I came across this article yesterday and thought you might find it interesting: [URL] It discusses some new evidence about the diet of Homo erectus and how it may have differed from what we previously thought. I was wondering if you had seen this article and what your thoughts are on it. Do you think this new information could have any implications for our research on early human migrations?

Looking forward to hearing back from you and hopefully catching up soon!

Reagan,

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Hi Javier,

I hope you're doing well. I've been thinking more about our potential research project, and I had a few ideas I wanted to share with you.

One of the challenges we might face is finding a suitable dataset that contains both economic and linguistic variables. We could potentially use a corpus of texts from different regions and time periods, and then collect economic data for those same regions and time periods. What do you think?

I also wanted to discuss the statistical methods we might use for the analysis. Since we'll be working with both numerical and categorical variables, we'll need to choose models that can handle this type of data. I have some experience with mixed-effects models, but I'm open to other suggestions.

Let me know your thoughts on these ideas. I'm excited to continue brainstorming with you!

Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

REGARDS
MARIA.

Subject: RE: Interdisciplinary Course Planning

Emily,

Thank you for your email and for sharing your ideas. I agree that we should focus on key concepts in evolutionary biology and use innovative teaching methods to help students understand these complex topics.

However, I think we should also consider incorporating some current research findings on the evolution of glycosylated proteins and their functions in mammalian organisms. This could provide students with a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying evolution and how they relate to the bigger picture.

In terms of teaching methodologies, I believe we should also include some computer simulations and modeling activities to help students visualize and explore evolutionary processes. This could complement the other teaching methods you mentioned and provide a more comprehensive learning experience.

I'm happy to work with you to further develop these ideas and create a course that effectively combines our expertise in biology and education. Please let me know your thoughts and if you have any suggestions for incorporating glycosylated proteins into the course.

Subject: Help with math concepts for new lesson plan

Hey Alex,

I hope your pre-calculus class is going well! I'm reaching out because I could use your help with some math concepts for a new lesson plan I'm developing. I'm creating a unit on the role of mathematics and cryptography during World War II, focusing on Alan Turing and the Enigma machine.

I know you're studying modular arithmetic and congruences right now, which is directly related to the math used in the Enigma machine. Would you be willing to help me understand these concepts better so I can incorporate them into my lesson plan? I'd really appreciate your expertise!

Let me know if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on this project. I think it could be a great way to combine our interests and create an engaging learning experience for my students.

Thanks in advance,
Emily",research,No

Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback on my chapters! I agree that we should expand on the potential side effects and long-term impacts of the treatments. I'll make those revisions and send the updated draft back to you by early next week.

I've also been thinking about our presentation at the medical conference. I love the idea of incorporating some of the patient stories from the book. I think it will help to make the information more relatable and impactful for the audience. I can work on putting together an outline for our talk and send it your way for feedback.

Subject: RE: Seeking your expertise on early colonial interactions

Emily,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad to see that you're delving into such an important topic. I've recently come across a fascinating primary source that I think might be of interest to you. It's a journal entry from a First Fleet officer that provides a detailed account of their initial interactions with the Indigenous people they encountered. I believe it could offer some valuable insights for your project.

I'd be happy to share a copy of the journal entry with you. Additionally, I can recommend a few other resources that might be relevant to your research. There's a book titled ""Encounters: The First Fleet and Aboriginal Australians"" that I found to be particularly informative.

I'm also considering attending a seminar on Indigenous land rights next month. I think it could be a great opportunity to learn more about the ongoing impact of colonial settlement on Indigenous communities. Would you be interested in joining me?

I look forward to discussing your project further and seeing what you uncover.

Best,

Thanks for your email. I've just finished reviewing the latest draft of our paper, and I must say, it looks excellent! The revisions you made really tie our arguments together nicely. I have a few minor suggestions for the conclusion, but overall, I believe we have a strong and compelling case.

As for the travel arrangements, I haven't booked my flights yet, but I will do so today. I agree that it would be best to coordinate our schedules to make the most of the pre-conference events. I'll let you know my flight details as soon as I have them.

I'm also excited about the potential impact our work could have on the field. The evidence we've uncovered challenges some long-held beliefs about Homo erectus and Neandertal interactions. I'm eager to see how our colleagues respond and engage with our findings.

Keep me posted on any further updates, and let's touch base again early next week to finalize our presentation.

Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a

if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Subject: New paper on fossil spatial analysis

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share with you my latest paper on a new statistical method for analyzing the spatial distribution of fossils in rock layers. I think you might find it interesting, given your work in geochronology and paleontology.

The paper is titled ""A novel approach to quantifying the spatial structure of fossil assemblages using multi-scale point pattern analysis"" and was just published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. I've attached a copy for your reference.

In the paper, I present a new method that combines geo-spatial analysis techniques with statistical tools to identify patterns in the distribution of fossils within rock layers. The method allows for a more detailed understanding of ancient ecosystems and can help us test hypotheses about the environmental factors that influenced the distribution of species in the past.

I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on the paper and whether you think this approach could be useful for your own research. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss further!

Ray,

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California""?

Subject: Collaborating on a project to promote child health through storytelling

Dear Liam,

It was great meeting you at the Child Health and Development Conference last month. I was impressed by your presentation on the power of storytelling in early childhood education and thought your approach could be a great complement to my work on adolescent non-communicable diseases prevention at WHO.

I'm reaching out to explore the possibility of collaborating on a project that combines our expertise. I believe that by integrating health education and storytelling, we could create engaging and effective educational materials for young children to promote healthy habits and prevention strategies.

Would you be interested in discussing this further? I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we could work together to make a positive impact on child health and education.

Best regards,

Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I was at a conference recently and was inspired to create a project for our students that combines genetics and the history of its discovery. I immediately thought of you and your amazing work with primary sources and digital archives in history class.

Would you be interested in collaborating on this project? I think it could be a great way to engage students and help them see the connections between science and history. We could create lesson plans that incorporate primary sources related to key figures and events in the history of genetics, and design activities that encourage critical thinking and analysis.

Let me know what you think! I'd love to brainstorm ideas with you and see if this is something we could pursue.

Hi Jordan,

I hope this email finds you well. I was just reminiscing about our time at the conference and the great discussions we had about the intersection of our fields. I've made an incredible discovery that I think you'll be particularly interested in.

While conducting a survey in a remote area, I stumbled upon what appears to be a previously unknown fish weir site. The structure is remarkably well-preserved, and I believe it could provide valuable insights into the ancient fishing practices and the surrounding ecosystem at the time of its construction.

I immediately thought of you and your expertise in native plant species. I was hoping you could join me on this project and help me analyze the plant life in and around the site. Your input could be crucial in dating the weir and understanding its environmental context.

I know you're busy, but I would be thrilled to have you on board. Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.

Larry,

Thank you for getting back with me.  To answer your question:  It is looking 
more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using 
approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have 
input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.  

I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
Engineer(s).

I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be 
going, and for which days.

Thank you,

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a ""sell through/sell with"" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Hey Olivia,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking a lot about our conversations and your fascinating work in thermal medicine. I truly believe that my readers would be captivated by your research and the potential of this alternative treatment. 

I know you're hesitant about writing for a blog, but I have a proposal for you. What if we collaborated on a guest post? You could provide the technical details and findings, and I would help make it accessible and engaging for a general audience. It would be a great way to raise awareness about your work and the future of cancer treatment.

Let me know what you think! If you're interested, I can send you some more information about my blog, audience, and the kind of content I usually produce. I'm excited about the possibility of working together and sharing your groundbreaking research with the world.

Subject: technical help for interviewing traders

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: RE: Introduction and Collaboration on Paleontology Course

Hi Alex,

Thank you for your email and the course outline you shared. I really like your idea of including interactive 3D models of fossils – it will definitely enhance the learning experience. However, I think we should also include some additional content on the geological context of these fossils and how they fit into the larger picture of Earth's history.

I've made some suggestions and edits to the outline, which I've attached to this email. Please feel free to review and provide your thoughts. I'm open to further discussion and refinement.

Regarding our call, Wednesday morning works great for me. Please send over the calendar invite whenever convenient.

I'm excited to see how this course takes shape and am looking forward to our collaboration!

I'll also start working on the overview for the handouts and will send you a draft early next week. Please feel free to make any changes or additions as you see fit.

Phillip,

I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both
the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment.
Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure
that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described
below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at (512)
370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: Intriguing discussion at the ICA conference

Dear Samuel,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm glad to hear that our discussions at the conference left a lasting impression. Your research on the new species of Salticidae jumping spider with unique mimicry abilities sounds truly remarkable, and I would be very interested in learning more about your findings.

The potential link between modern spider behavior and their ancient ancestors is a fascinating area of research, and I believe that our combined expertise could indeed lead to some groundbreaking discoveries. The newly discovered fossil site in Mongolia is an extraordinary opportunity to gather valuable data and specimens that could shed light on the evolutionary history of spider mimicry and communication.

I would be delighted to discuss the possibility of a collaboration and the joint grant application in more detail. Perhaps we could set up a video call next week to share our latest research findings and explore the potential for a joint project?

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Subject: RE: Inquiry about Acadian history resources

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you for reaching out, and I'm delighted to hear about your curriculum project. As someone who is passionate about Acadian history and its role in shaping the unique culture of Louisiana, I would be more than happy to assist you in any way I can.

I think it's wonderful that you're incorporating primary sources and historical documents into your lessons. Some excellent resources to consider include:

1. The ""Memorial of the French Inhabitants of Louisiana to the King of France"" (1755)
2. The ""Treaty of Paris"" (1763)
3. First-hand accounts from Acadian deportees during the Grand Dérangement (1755-1764)
4. Newspaper articles from the time period discussing the Acadians' plight

In terms of engaging lesson ideas, I've found that role-playing activities, where students take on the perspectives of different historical figures, can be incredibly effective in helping them understand the complexities of the time period.

I'm also happy to provide some broader historical context and analysis to help frame the materials you incorporate into your lessons.

Please feel free to reach out with any other questions or requests. I look forward to working with you on this important project.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

Subject: Exciting discovery in Puerto Rico!

David,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some incredible news with you. While digging through the archives at the University of Puerto Rico, I stumbled upon a collection of letters between Puerto Rican independence activists from the late 19th century. The letters discuss the role of genetics in shaping the island's identity and resisting colonial oppression.

I immediately thought of our research project and how these letters could provide valuable context for our work. I've attached a few scanned copies of the most relevant letters for you to take a look at.

What do you think about incorporating these letters into our study? I believe they could offer a unique perspective on the intersection of history, genetics, and social justice in Puerto Rico.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best regards,
Maria",research,No

Phillip,

Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:

1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.

2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review.

3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?

4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Mery

Hi Alex,

Thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement. It means so much to me to have a trusted colleague and mentor like you to turn to as I navigate this new role.

I love your idea of co-authoring an article or presenting at a conference together! That could be a fantastic way to share our insights and experiences with a broader audience and to amplify our impact. I would be thrilled to collaborate with you on a project like that. Let's touch base soon to brainstorm some specific ideas and to identify potential outlets or events where we could share our work.

In the meantime, I will keep you posted on my progress and will definitely reach out with any questions or updates. I'm so grateful for your partnership and for the opportunity to work together to create more inclusive and equitable schools.

Thank you again for everything!

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Regards,
Gary

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

Hi Daniel,

I'm so glad you like the revisions! I'll incorporate your suggestions for additional examples this weekend. Dinner on the 15th sounds great - I'll do some research on the best restaurants in the area and send you my top picks.

I completely agree with you about the potential impact of our research. It's been such a rewarding collaboration, and I'm excited to see where it takes us next. Speaking of which, have you given any more thought to the idea of publishing our work in an academic journal? I think it could really help us reach a wider audience and get more feedback from our peers.

Let me know what you think, and I'll start looking into potential journals that might be a good fit for our paper.

Thank you so much for accommodating my visit on such short notice. I'm thrilled that we'll have the opportunity to discuss our research in person.

If possible, I'd love to learn more about the chemical analysis techniques you use for dating and understanding the composition of archaeological materials. I think this could be particularly relevant to my work on prehistoric fish weirs and the materials used in their construction.

I'm also interested in any insights you might have on how the mole concept could be applied to archaeological chemistry. I've been reading up on it since our last conversation, and I think there could be some exciting possibilities for our collaboration.

Please let me know if there's anything I can do to prepare for our meeting. I'm eager to learn from you and your team.

You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Subject: RE: Exciting research opportunity

Dear Amelia,

Next Friday, April 16th, at 10 AM AEST works perfectly for me. I'll send you a calendar invite with the video conference details. I've also reached out to my contacts at the Australian Research Council and have a meeting scheduled with them next week to discuss our project.

I'm glad to hear that your daughter, Sophia, is also interested in science. Finn would be thrilled to meet her. Let's plan a weekend get-together once we have made some progress on our project. Perhaps we could visit a local science museum or organize a picnic in a park where the kids can explore nature together.

I'm equally excited about the potential impact our collaboration could have on public health and agriculture. With our combined expertise, I believe we can make significant strides in this innovative research.

Looking forward to our video conference next week.

Best regards,
Liam",research,No

It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron is

Subject: Concerns about the new Zika strain

Dear Dr. Patel,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across some disturbing news about a new strain of the Zika virus that has been identified in our region. As you know, we've been working together to address vector-borne diseases for years now, and I believe this development warrants our immediate attention.

Given your expertise in infectious diseases and your connections in Singapore, I was wondering if you might have any insights or recommendations on how we can tackle this emerging threat. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the vector control program you mentioned during our last webinar, as I believe it could be a valuable model for us to consider here in Miami.

Would you be available for a call next week to discuss this further? I'd love to brainstorm some ideas and explore potential collaborative efforts to address this outbreak.

Best regards,

Alex,

Thanks for the update! I'm thrilled to hear about the new fossil data and can't wait to dive into your analysis. I'll review everything this weekend and send you my feedback early next week.

I'm also excited about the hiking plans you've been working on. It's going to be incredible to see these sites in person and imagine what life was like for both the reptiles and humans who inhabited the region millions of years ago.

On a separate note, I came across an interesting article about the use of reptile bones as tools by early humans in the American Southwest. I'll forward it to you, as I think it could provide some valuable context for our research.

I'm looking forward to our call next week and discussing our next steps for the project. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help in the meantime.

Best,

Is AMF willing to put up the additional earnest money and acknowledge June 29th as the day they were supposed to close  or do they believe they are honoring the contract by closing on July 18th?  Of course, I would prefer to close as soon as possible.  

I received the fax from the stagecoach.  I am willing to pay any small expenses like the phone bill incurred prior to April 20th.  What is the status of the release and the utility transfer?

The buyer wants to close on July 18 or 19th. According to the contract they
must close one month after all requirements have been met or put up an
additional $25,000 in NON-REFUNDABLE earnest money.  The zoning was approved
on May 29.

However, the official zoning designation has not been done yet and may not
be approved until around the 1st of Aug.  Give me a call when you get back.

Subject: RE: Annual Hiking Trip - Your Input Needed!

Hi Alex,

It's great to hear from you! I'm thrilled that you're taking the lead on planning our hiking trip this year. Both the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest sound amazing, but I think I'd lean towards the coastal hike. There's just something magical about the ocean breeze and the rugged coastline that I find incredibly refreshing.

As for your gastroenterologist appointment, try not to worry too much. The doctor will likely start with a thorough medical history and physical exam, and then discuss any necessary tests or procedures. Remember, they're there to help you, so don't hesitate to ask questions or voice any concerns you may have. If you'd like, I can recommend a fantastic gastroenterologist in your area who I think you'd really like.

On another note, I've been giving a lot of thought to that job offer I mentioned. It's a fantastic opportunity, but the thought of leaving my current practice and moving away from friends and family is really weighing on me. I know I can always count on your objective perspective, so I'd love to chat more about this when we have a chance.

Let me know what you think about the coastal hike, and we can start making more concrete plans. I'm excited to get out on the trails with you again!

Michael,

Thanks for your prompt response. I've just finished analyzing the network traffic logs from one of the affected clients, and I found something disturbing. The malware seems to have been delivered through a spear-phishing email that originated from within the client's own network. This suggests that the attackers may have had help from an insider.

I've attached the relevant logs for your review. Can you take a look and let me know your thoughts?

Also, I'll join the call at 2 PM. In the meantime, I'll continue working on identifying the extent of the damage and gathering more evidence.

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

     Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
     summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

     1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions
     you

     2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for
     Topics
     reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
     sign-off on each topic.

     3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
     incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We

Phillip,

I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a 
table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you 
oblige?  Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Subject: Workshop feedback and future collaborations

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to thank you again for your fantastic collaboration during the professional development workshop. The feedback we received from our colleagues was overwhelmingly positive, and I believe our presentation made a significant impact.

Several teachers approached us after the workshop, expressing their interest in implementing some of our strategies in their classrooms. I think this is a testament to the effectiveness of our collaborative approach.

I'd love to continue working with you on more projects and share our knowledge with other teachers in the school. Perhaps we can organize a series of workshops or create a resource bank for our colleagues to access.

Let me know your thoughts, and let's schedule a meeting to discuss our next steps.

Best regards,
Sarah",research,No

Subject: Re:  

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, 
we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.

any questions please feel free to call.

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm glad to hear you're as intrigued by this mystery as I am. I would be more than happy to discuss my experience in Pineville and any potential environmental factors I noticed during my trip.

Next week works well for me to set up a call and plan our research trip to Willow Creek. I'm available on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning, if either of those times work for you. I'll also start gathering any relevant data and resources we might need for our field research.

I'm looking forward to working together on this project and uncovering the truth behind these mysterious occurrences.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Unusual feature on Io

Hi Emily,

Great to hear that you're as excited about this finding as I am! I'm glad you agree that it could be a significant discovery. I think collaborating with our colleagues at the institute is an excellent idea. Their expertise in planetary geology and volcanism will be invaluable in interpreting this data.

I'm available next Monday and Wednesday afternoons if that works for you. We could meet in the lab and go over the data together. Let me know what time suits you best.

Your section on Europa's subsurface ocean sounds fascinating! I think it will be a great addition to our presentation. I agree that highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of our research will showcase the strength of our collaboration.

I'll send you the latest draft of my section by the end of this week for your feedback. I'm happy to make any adjustments based on your suggestions.

Looking forward to our meeting next week!

Best,
Jordan",research,No

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Phillip Allen

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela.  Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable.  She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity.  Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource.  Thanks for allowing my program her services 
and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

My risk group frequently uses the New Counterparty label for internal 
counterparties that do not have a trading book.  This transaction was a hedge 
for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.  I'm not sure 
who the internal group is that did the transaction.  Dutch Quigley should be 
able to help.

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million

        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale

million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

Sarah,

That's fantastic to hear that you're still at NetTech and working on projects you're passionate about. I've always admired your expertise in low-level network programming and your ability to optimize system performance. It's no wonder they've kept you around!

As for my startup idea, I've been developing a novel network protocol that aims to improve the efficiency and security of data transmission in distributed systems. I believe it could have applications in various industries, from cloud computing to IoT devices.

I'd love to share more details and get your input. How about we schedule a video call for next Tuesday at 3 PM? That way, we can discuss it in real-time and maybe even do a quick screen share if needed.

Let me know if that works for you, and feel free to bring any ideas you've been working on as well. I'm excited to collaborate and see what we can create together!

Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our last email about the conference proposal. I've been thinking about our discussion and I think we have a really strong case for presenting our findings on the language used in scientific literature related to invasive species. 

I've attached a draft of the proposal for your review. Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions for improvements. We can also discuss this further when we have our call next week.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best,

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

jacques,

I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.

Emily,

Thank you for sending your paper. I've just finished reading it, and I'm impressed by your findings. The correlation between linguistic patterns and genetic evidence is striking, and I believe our collaboration has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of human history.

I have a few ideas for our next steps:

1. Identify key linguistic and genetic markers that we can use to trace migration patterns more accurately.
2. Collaborate with other experts in the field to gather additional data and insights.
3. Outline a timeline for our research and publication goals.

I'd love to discuss these ideas further and hear your thoughts. Are you available for a video call next week?

Re: trucking LNG to California - 

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

Hi Jenna,

It's great to hear from you! Thanks for reaching out about this policy proposal. I've been following its development closely, and I'm thrilled that it's gaining traction. You're right, this could be a huge win for the Woodland Elktoad and other endangered amphibians.

I'd be more than happy to collaborate with you on this. My experience with policy advocacy, combined with your expertise in field conservation, could make a real difference in getting this proposal passed. I'm confident that together, we can make a strong case for the importance of protecting these critical habitats.

I'm available for a call on either Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning next week, so let me know which works best for you. In the meantime, I'll start gathering some data and case studies to support our arguments.

Looking forward to working with you on this important initiative!

Dear Dr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. We met at the dental conference last month where you gave an excellent lecture on impression making techniques. Your insights were truly inspiring, and I was wondering if you might be willing to offer some guidance on a particularly challenging case I'm working on.

I'm a dental lab technician specializing in restorative dentistry, and I've been struggling to create a precise dental prosthesis for a patient with a complex case. I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have to help me improve my technique and ensure the best possible outcome for my patient.

If you have any time in the coming weeks, I would be incredibly grateful for the opportunity to discuss this case with you further. Please let me know if you might be available for a brief phone call or video chat.

Thank you for reaching out! It was a pleasure meeting you at the CFR conference as well, and I echo your sentiments on the value of our conversation. Your presentation on the effectiveness of conflict resolution strategies in post-war Iraq was quite insightful, and I believe our research interests align quite well.

I would be delighted to stay in touch and explore potential collaborations. As someone who has been in the field for some time now, I always appreciate the opportunity to work with bright, young scholars like yourself.

If you're open to it, I'd like to propose that we consider submitting a grant application to fund a more extensive study on this topic.

Subject: RE: Following up from the conference

Hi Alex,

3 PM your time on Tuesday works perfectly for me. I'll send you a calendar invite with the video call link.

I'll also start gathering some resources and ideas on my end. From my perspective, I think we should focus on how space activities can impact Earth's water resources (e.g., space debris re-entering the atmosphere) and how sustainable water management practices on Earth can inform space exploration and habitation.

Looking forward to our call and diving deeper into this project!

Subject: New project idea - Vocab and Physics

Hey Michael,

I hope you're having a great week so far! I wanted to run a new project idea by you that I think could be really engaging for our students. I was thinking about how we could combine vocabulary development with physics concepts, and I came up with an idea for a project called ""The Physics of Language.""

The basic premise is that students would choose a physics concept (like gravity, friction, or momentum) and then write a short story or poem that incorporates vocabulary words related to that concept. The story or poem would need to demonstrate an understanding of the physics concept and use the vocabulary words in a meaningful way.

I think this project could help our students see the connections between language and science, and it would give them a chance to be creative while also learning important concepts in both subjects. What do you think? Would you be interested in collaborating on this project with me?

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
Emily",research,No

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Dear Emily,

It's wonderful to hear from you! I remember our meeting at the conference and am thrilled to hear that my talk had a lasting impact on you. I would be more than happy to assist you in developing your lesson plan on the intersection of women's rights and politics in the 20th century.

Some key figures and events that I believe are essential to include are:

1. The women's suffrage movement and the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920
2. The role of women in the workforce during World War II and the subsequent push for equal pay
3. The Civil Rights Movement and the intersection of gender and race in the struggle for equality
4. The women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s, including the fight for reproductive rights and the Equal Rights Amendment
5. The impact of Title IX on women's education and athletics

As for resources, I highly recommend the following books:

- ""The Woman Suffrage Movement in America"" by Corrine M. McConnaughy
- ""The Feminine Mystique"" by Betty Friedan
- ""Sisterhood is Powerful"" edited by Robin Morgan
- ""The Second Sex"" by Simone de Beauvoir

I would be happy to discuss these topics further and provide additional resources if needed. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

Best of luck with your lesson plan!

Dear Dr. Bateman,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been making excellent progress on our bat etymology project, and I wanted to share some of my latest findings with you.

I've discovered that the Old English term for ""bat"" was ""flēogebȳgen,"" which literally translates to ""flying bug."" It's fascinating to see how the understanding of bats has evolved over time, and I believe this etymology could provide valuable insights into the historical perception of these creatures.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and any other bat-related terms you think would be relevant to our research. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

I'd be more than happy to meet with you and share some of my experiences and strategies for teaching the course. We can discuss the syllabus, textbook choices, assignments, and any other aspects of the course you'd like to cover.

How about we meet for coffee next Tuesday at 10 AM in the faculty lounge? That way, we can have a relaxed conversation and I can introduce you to some of our other colleagues who teach in the micro area.

I'm also excited to hear about your research interests in industrial organization. It's always a pleasure to collaborate with new faculty who share similar research interests. Perhaps we can explore potential research collaborations once you've settled into your new role.

Subject: RE: Collaborative project update

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for your email! I'm glad to hear you're excited about the project and the upcoming conference. I completely understand your concerns about simplifying the genetic concepts for our target audience. It's a challenge, but I'm confident we can find a way to make it accessible and engaging.

I think the key is to focus on the big picture and the real-world applications of these concepts. For example, instead of delving into the technical details of DNA sequencing, we could start with a basic explanation of what DNA is and why it's important. Then, we could discuss how sequencing DNA can help us understand genetic diseases and develop new treatments.

Here are a few resources that might help:

1. ""DNA 101"" video series by the National Human Genome Research Institute: https://www.genome.gov/video/dna-101-video-series
2. ""Your Genes, Your Health"" interactive website: http://www.ygyh.org/
3. ""Genetic Testing: What It Means for Your Health"" article by the U.S. National Library of Medicine: https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html

I'd be happy to discuss these resources further and brainstorm ways to incorporate them into our educational materials. Let me know what you think!

Subject: RE: Our research collaboration

Jenna,

Thanks for sharing your outline. I've had a chance to review it and I'm really impressed with your ideas. I think you've identified some key areas where our expertise can intersect in a meaningful way.

I've added a few notes and suggestions to the document, but overall I think we have a strong foundation to build upon. I'm particularly excited about the idea of examining historical disease patterns in colonial America and comparing them to modern-day vaccine development strategies.

I'll do some more digging in the historical records and see if I can find any relevant data to support our hypotheses. Let's discuss this further when we meet next week.

Best,

Jeff,

I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment documents.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from Pauline that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communicating through you is working well. 

Thanks for all your help.

Subject: RE: Exhibit stress and summer plans

Emily,

It's great to hear from you, although I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so stressed about the exhibit. I completely understand what you're going through. When I was in the final stages of writing my book, I felt like I was constantly on edge, questioning every word and worrying about meeting my deadline.

The most important thing, I think, is to remember to take care of yourself. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks when you need them. It's easy to let work consume you, but you'll be more productive and creative if you give yourself time to recharge.

It's also helpful to lean on your support system during times like these. Talk to your family and friends about what you're going through, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. And remember, even though it feels like the world is ending if this exhibit isn't perfect, there will be other opportunities and other exhibits. This is just one moment in your career.

I'm excited to hear about your potential trip to Mongolia! That sounds like an incredible opportunity, and I'm sure you'll discover some amazing fossils. I know it can be daunting to plan a trip like that, but I bet once you're out there, you'll be so caught up in the excitement of the research that you won't even think about the challenges.

As for our summer plans, yes, we are still hoping to get to the beach. We're thinking about renting a house on the Outer Banks for a week in July. I'm looking forward to some quality family time and a chance to relax after the intensity of the past year.

I'd love to get together soon to catch up in person. How about lunch next week? I can come to your neck of the woods, and we can talk more about your exhibit and your trip.

Hang in there, Emily. You're doing amazing work, and I know the exhibit will be a huge success. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.

Best,
Robert",research,No

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, 
we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.

any questions please feel free to call.

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.
