3,2811,"<email>David,I'm thrilled that you're as enthusiastic about this discovery as I am! I've attached images of the painting and a brief summary of my initial findings. As you'll see, the arrangement of the motifs follows a specific geometric pattern that seems to be based on trigonometric principles.While this particular painting is the most striking example I've found so far, I believe the use of mathematical principles in Japanese art and design during the Meiji era was more widespread than previously thought. I've come across several other examples that suggest a growing interest in incorporating geometric and mathematical concepts into artistic compositions during this period.I think this discovery could have significant implications for our understanding of the cultural and intellectual exchanges between Japan and the West during the Meiji era. It may also shed light on the ways in which Japanese artists and designers were adapting and integrating new ideas from the West while maintaining a distinct cultural identity.I'm excited to discuss this further and explore the potential for collaboration. I think we could develop a compelling joint publication that combines our expertise in art history and mathematics to shed new light on this fascinating aspect of Japanese art and culture.Please let me know your thoughts on the attached materials, and if you have any suggestions for further research or analysis.Best regards,Akiko",research,No

It's been a while since we connected, but I wanted to reach out because I think you might be interested in a new project we're working on at RenewableTech.We're in the early stages of developing a new geothermal power plant in the Cascades region of the Pacific Northwest. As you know, this area has significant geothermal potential, and we believe it's an ideal location for a large-scale geothermal energy project.Given your extensive research on the geological characteristics of the Cascades and their implications for geothermal energy production, I think your insights could be incredibly valuable to our team. I was wondering if you'd be interested in discussing potential collaboration opportunities, either as a consultant or a research partner.If you're open to the idea, I'd be happy to set up a call to discuss the project in more detail and answer any questions you might have.

Your lecture on the Telangana movement was fascinating, and I've been thinking about the parallels between political satire and grassroots activism ever since.I'd be happy to share some thoughts on satire and social change for your book. In my experience, humor has the power to cut through political rhetoric and speak to people's shared values and experiences. By holding up a mirror to society's absurdities, satirical fiction can inspire people to question the status quo and push for change.As for my new novel, it's been a wild ride so far. The more I delve into the commercialization of holidays, the more I realize how deeply it reflects our society's priorities and values. It's a rich vein of material, to say the least.I'm also excited to explore the city and connect with the local literary community. If you have any recommendations for writers' groups or book clubs, I'd be grateful for the introduction.Looking forward to our continued collaboration!Best,Zack",research,No

We should be able to work with this.Phillip -----Original Message-----Sent:	Monday, November 05, 2001 5:11 PMCc:	donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com; kmcdani@enron.comPhillip,The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussionswith the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get yourapproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building theapplication.We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner'sdecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward intime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order toachieve this, we will have the following constraints:   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw   gas. What you should have done was...""   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to   start over at time period one.   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this   task.We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq frameworkdoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. Thetechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our currentdevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learneron the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make themistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of dayWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of thissimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please letme know if you would like to set up a meeting.Thank you.MeryThis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged or confidential information.

30,2031,"George,The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

31,1100,"---------------------- 12:28 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

Regarding the cache performance issue, I think non-uniform cache architectures could indeed be a viable solution. I've done some research on the topic, and I believe it could help alleviate the bottlenecks you're experiencing.I can share some papers and resources that might be useful for your implementation. Let's schedule a call this week to discuss it in more detail.As for the research paper, I'm excited to see your outline! I've been reviewing the data as well, and I think we have a strong case for the benefits of our proposed memory management techniques. If you can send me your outline, I'll provide my feedback and suggestions.It's been a while since we caught up, so I'd love to hear more about your new role at TechSavvy. Are you enjoying it so far?Looking forward to our call and collaborating on the paper!Best,Jordan",research,No

I'll keep you posted on our progress and will definitely share some results with you once we have something solid. As for your question about science and policy, I could write a whole book on that topic. One example that comes to mind is the debate over hydraulic fracturing (fracking).

It's frustrating to see decision-makers ignoring or cherry-picking the science like that.I'd be happy to talk more about this with you, either over email or in person if you're ever in town.

In  each of the nine insta=nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =months.

82,2730,"<email>Hi Emily,Thanks for reaching out! I'm thrilled to be working with you on this exciting project. I've reviewed the list of digital tools you sent over, and I think they have great potential for enhancing our language arts curriculum. I've also added a few more resources to the shared document that I believe could be valuable.Regarding our budget for educational software, I've started researching some options and have a few initial recommendations. I think we should prioritize tools that are user-friendly, compatible with our existing systems, and offer strong support for reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. Let's discuss this further when we meet next week.I'm confident that with our combined expertise and creativity, we'll create a cutting-edge curriculum that will engage and inspire our students.

We can discuss this further once the project is launched and we've recovered from the conference.I think we're just about ready to launch the project.

While I believe that infrastructure development is essential for improving quality of life, I can see how it can also perpetuate dependence if not done with the needs and desires of the community in mind.In my current project, we've been working closely with local leaders and residents to ensure that the new roads and bridges we're building serve the community's needs and are maintained sustainably.

101,700,"---------------------- 10:55 AM ---------------------------   				  It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk.",corporate,No

We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

152,2771,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still havethe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:     Unit Cost, Site work, &     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million     Land                      1.15     Interim Financing               .85     Common Areas                     .80     Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.

179,1410,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

190,2421,"<email>Hi Jenna,It sounds like you're off to a great start in your new role! Your plans for building relationships and providing professional development are exactly the right approach. In terms of specific strategies, one thing I've found effective is to use a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. UDL is all about designing instruction and environments that are accessible and engaging for all learners from the start, rather than trying to retrofit accommodations after the fact. There are some great resources available from CAST, the organization that developed the UDL framework, that could be really helpful for your trainings.Another strategy that's worked well for me is to establish a clear protocol for identifying and addressing barriers to access and inclusion. This could involve regular audits of classrooms and school facilities, as well as soliciting feedback from students, parents, and teachers about any challenges they're experiencing. The key is to have a systematic way of identifying issues and then collaboratively developing solutions.In terms of challenges, one of the biggest hurdles I've faced is resistance to change from some stakeholders who are comfortable with the status quo. In those situations, I've found it helpful to focus on building relationships and finding common ground, while also being clear and direct about the needs of our students and the legal requirements we must meet.I'm happy to share more about my experiences and strategies in future emails. I'm also excited to hear about the progress you make in your new role and to support you however I can!Best,Alex",research,No

204,109,"Good to hear from you.After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.  i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.  slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/26/2001 04:48:06 PM  its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-notawful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front ofmarch/apr a cupla times, no disasters.   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month agoto you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas demand.now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but hereyou go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y ony swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C demanddenergy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effectutilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan forthis factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power pxesrise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in thesummer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. isay 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing isanother .7/1bcf/d loss.  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top oflast years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 3.6tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower torestore demand??? thots.as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and illkeep you posted.",student,No
205,2274,"<email>Emily,Thank you for sharing your syllabus. I'm impressed by the depth and breadth of the material you cover in your course. It's fascinating to see how the interpretation of foundational documents has evolved over time in response to social justice issues in the United States.Your course reminded me of a book I recently read titled ""The Evolution of Civil Rights: Exploring the Intersection of Law and Social Change"" by Dr. Lila Gupta. I think you might find it relevant to your work, as it examines the interplay between legal frameworks and social movements in advancing civil rights.I'm also intrigued by the idea of comparing our respective approaches to teaching about historical conflicts. In my courses, I often emphasize the role of colonial legacies and modern geopolitics in shaping the Kashmir conflict. I wonder if there are parallels to be drawn with the role of historical documents and social movements in the American context.I would be interested in exploring potential collaboration opportunities, perhaps in the form of a comparative analysis or a co-taught course.Sanjay",research,No

Cash NeedsHighlights:SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan",student,No

211,1288,"i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.  slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 PM  you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med longerterm. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the curvegets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between say3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at somepoint and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 ctscuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this summer-lowlow stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about winter-aswe see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive howthis got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05John.Arnold@enron.com on 01/31/2001 05:41:45 PMFax to:quit pressuring them    i want to sell some too.  actually sold a few at 9on the closeslafontaine@globalp.com on 01/31/2001 12:40:07 PMi hate hate that sprd-at 8 cts i think its such a good bearsprd-hope itkeepscoming in. ill tell you why later",corporate,No

I've sent you a calendar invite for the call, and I'll include the relevant files and data in advance so you can review them beforehand.Your idea to consult with a paleoclimatologist is brilliant. Understanding the environmental context of the site will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the lives of the Neolithic people and how they adapted to the challenges posed by the volcanic eruption and changing climate.I've been giving some thought to the potential impact of the eruption on the surrounding landscape, and I believe it could have had a significant effect on the placement and design of the burial site. The presence of volcanic ash and other deposits in the area may have influenced the choice of burial locations and the materials used in the construction of the tombs.I'm also curious to explore any potential ritual or symbolic significance the Neolithic people may have attributed to the volcanic event. It's possible that the eruption and its aftermath played a role in their spiritual beliefs and burial practices.I'll be sure to include these thoughts in our discussion on Tuesday, and I look forward to hearing your perspective on these ideas.Thank you again for your collaboration and enthusiasm, Finn. I have no doubt that our combined expertise will lead to a groundbreaking understanding of this remarkable site and the people who lived through such a transformative event.Best regards,Eleanor",research,No

222,2400,"<email>Hi Emily,Great to hear from you! I'm glad the class went well and that the students found it valuable. I'd definitely be interested in discussing the latest economic data with you further.In terms of the new variants, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the increased transmissibility is concerning from a public health perspective. But from an economic standpoint, the fact that they seem to be leading to fewer hospitalizations and deaths is a positive sign.I'm also very interested in moving forward with that research paper idea. I think there's a lot of potential there to explore the cost-effectiveness of different containment strategies. Let me know when you're available to brainstorm next steps.Looking forward to catching up more soon!Best,Alex",research,No

The principal change is in theaddition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate willcosts at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costshave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more thansufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&Ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit andoffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in asa rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanentmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for theconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when thisloan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, theconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.George W.

Our primary research questions include:1. Identifying key migration routes and timing for each species2. Investigating potential environmental factors influencing migration patterns (e.g., sea surface temperature, prey availability)3. Assessing potential threats to whale populations along their migration routes (e.g., shipping lanes, coastal development)I would be happy to have a call next week to discuss these questions in more detail and begin planning our analysis.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge= of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since= September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost= of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses= will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress= on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower= our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in= the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a= year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127= million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating= expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of= $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and= therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.= Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due= primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the= company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax= ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=re-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =American Express Company (http://www.americanexpress.com ), founded in 1850=, is a global travel, financial and network services provider.

250,2922,"<email>Aisha,I completely agree with your suggestion for structuring the paper. Having each of us take the lead on sections that align with our expertise and perspectives, while ensuring an overall balanced approach, will make for a stronger and more compelling piece.As for specific aspects to focus on, I think it's crucial that we examine the historical context of the conflict, particularly the events leading up to the current flare-up in violence. We should also analyze the geopolitical implications, both in terms of India-Pakistan relations and the broader regional dynamics (e.g., China's role, the impact on Afghanistan, etc.).Additionally, I believe we should address the human rights issues at play, particularly the plight of the Kashmiri people caught in the middle of this long-standing dispute. This is an area where I think your insights and expertise would be particularly valuable.Let's touch base next week to finalize our outline and divide up the research and writing tasks. I'm happy to take the lead on the historical and geopolitical sections, while you focus on the human rights aspects and the Kashmiri perspective.Looking forward to our continued collaboration!Best regards,Rajesh",research,No

290,2023,"<email>Hey Michael,I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out because I've finally completed the draft for the first section of our dictionary project. I've attached the file to this email, and I would really appreciate it if you could take a look and provide some feedback.As I was working on this, I started thinking about how our research could potentially contribute to the field of lexicography. What do you think about the idea of co-authoring a paper on our findings once the dictionary is complete? I think it could be a great opportunity to share our work with the wider linguistic community.Let me know your thoughts on both the draft and the paper idea. I'm excited to hear your feedback and continue working on this project together.Best regards,Sarah",research,No

296,2517,"<email>Hey Michael,I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something exciting with you that I learned at the chemistry education conference last week. I attended a session on a new teaching method called ""Modeling Instruction"" that I think could be really beneficial for our students.The basic idea behind Modeling Instruction is to engage students in building and testing mental models of chemical concepts through a series of guided inquiries and activities. The goal is to help students develop a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms of chemistry.I've attached a few resources that provide an overview of the method and some example activities. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it and discuss whether we might be able to incorporate some of these ideas into our curriculum.Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to chat more about this!Best,Emily",research,No

308,1075,"Gentlemen,Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

317,57,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256.  I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time.The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:Jan  -.008Feb -.004Mar -.001Apr .002May .003Jun .004Jul .004Aug .004Sep .003Oct .002Nov -.003Dec -.006These premiums start in Jan 2004On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475.

Your work is making such an impact and it's wonderful that you're sharing it with the world in such an engaging way.I'll see you soon at the science fair! Let me know if you need anything else.Best,Michael",research,No

322,2943,"<email>Liam,Thank you for sending the calendar invite. I've accepted it and added the Zoom link to my schedule.I completely agree with the themes you've suggested for the stories. Focusing on healthy eating habits, physical activity, emotional well-being, and hygiene and disease prevention is crucial, especially in the current context. We could also consider incorporating messages about the importance of sleep and limiting screen time, as these are often overlooked aspects of child health.Your idea to create a framework or guidelines for adapting the stories to different cultural contexts is brilliant. We could consult with experts in cultural competence and early childhood education to ensure our approach is inclusive and effective.I've been thinking about potential funding sources for our project. I have some contacts at the World Health Organization and UNICEF who might be interested in supporting our initiative. I'd be happy to reach out to them and explore the possibilities.Looking forward to our call next week to discuss these ideas further!Best,Sophia",research,No

324,2509,"<email>Dear Dr. Johnson,Our meeting on Tuesday was incredibly productive, and I'm thrilled with the direction we've decided to take the project. The students will be researching and creating digital art pieces based on the following events:1. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783)2. The Whiskey Rebellion (1794)3. The Louisiana Purchase (1803)4. The Battle of New Orleans (1815)I've created a shared folder with resources for each event, which I've shared with you. Please feel free to add any additional resources you think would be helpful for the students.I'll introduce the project to the students next week and begin the research phase. We'll keep you updated on their progress, and we can schedule another meeting to discuss their initial ideas for the digital art pieces.Thank you again for your collaboration and expertise.

326,2179,"<email>Hi Jenna,It's great to hear from you! Congratulations on your new position - that's exciting news. I'm happy to share some insights and strategies that have worked well for me in creating inclusive school environments.One of the most important things, I've found, is to start by building relationships with key stakeholders - administrators, teachers, parents, and students. It's crucial to have open and honest conversations about the needs of students with disabilities and to collaborate on developing policies and practices that support their success.Another key strategy is to provide ongoing professional development and training for educators, focusing on best practices for teaching and supporting students with disabilities. It's also important to ensure that accommodations and modifications are consistently implemented and that students have access to the tools and resources they need to thrive academically and socially.I'd be happy to share more detailed recommendations and resources, and I'm also curious to learn more about your new role and the specific challenges you anticipate. It sounds like an exciting opportunity to make a real difference for your students!Best,Alex",research,No
327,1450,"Good plan.I agree re SJ.  She is on the ball.mh	Patrick Tucker	12/14/00 04:28 PM				 		  Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications		 I agree.  Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward.  I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future.  I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked.  Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours.  Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process.  I have certainly found her involvement invaluable.

This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points:   a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person.  We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the veryviabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share undereithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under CompanyA,and so on.     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine thepricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the explorationprojectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over priceoffersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?     $______ per/share",student,No

It appears that there's a new type of malware that has been targeting financial institutions, and I believe it could pose a significant threat to our clients.The malware, dubbed ""FinStealer,"" is designed to infiltrate banking systems and steal sensitive customer data.

356,1465,"Chaz & Steve,I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with Jennifer Medcalf.  During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has with regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn't been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net Works has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels that without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely fashion.The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and not in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the (Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) ""...haven't kept up with the industry"", and that they (Net Works) have some residual issues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed by Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification and liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge for Net Works in the form of ""advance purchase"" of BMC product.For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total Enron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC time to ""click"" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other $2 million is used as a ""future purchases"" fund, in which EBS buys, but does not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current software...THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is delivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product when they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with BMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to you.If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on progress.Thanks,JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716",corporate,No

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

You may recall having met Mike Rabon in the October 6th meeting. Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it pertains to:Near term network planning.IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit capacity.Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about your storage strategy and growth.Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the hubs.Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic and video traffic to traverse the same network.

We would appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.Background:Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in weather derivatives and plastics hedging.December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific preference?Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather derivatives opportunities, respectively.  Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

461,1462,"Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354	Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com	12/18/00 07:58 PM		 		 		  		 Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin ""Owns"" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.Afterour meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as thepoint person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaqtodirect our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe orKentMajor.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional timewithDavid to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities andissues.EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to developthestreaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meetingthatthere are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and ServerSupplyAgreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS andCompaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the ProductandServer Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS hashadinternal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further ourrelationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal frameworkforour relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until thosechanges are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaqwasinvoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoiceamount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section3.0 onor before December 31,2000.2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,Compaq(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   Theunderstanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written noticeandpayment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a newcontractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBSstrongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaqbelieves that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we lookforward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and createstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354",corporate,Yes

The pieces you've shared look absolutely stunning, and I can already tell this is going to be a truly exceptional showcase of Heian period Buddhist art.I'd be more than happy to provide whatever insights and advice I can to help bring your curatorial vision to life. After looking through the images, a few key themes and ideas immediately jumped out at me that I think could be really powerful to explore in the exhibit:1. The evolution of Buddhist iconography over the course of the Heian period, and how changes in artistic style and representation reflect the shifting religious and political landscape of the time.2. The role of art and aesthetics in Heian period Buddhist practice, and how these artifacts would have functioned within ritual and devotional contexts.3. The influence of Chinese and Korean Buddhist art on Heian period artists and artisans, and the ways in which they adapted and transformed these foreign styles to create something uniquely Japanese.I'd be happy to expand on any of these ideas further, and to offer suggestions on how you might group and present the artifacts to bring out these themes most effectively. I'm also happy to look over any labels or interpretive text you're developing to provide feedback and edits.It's been far too long since we last saw each other, and I would love to find an opportunity to meet up again soon. Perhaps I could plan a trip to Kyoto once the exhibit is installed?

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W.

The dataset includes measurements of various anatomical features, such as limb lengths, skull dimensions, and tooth sizes, as well as information about the geological context of each specimen.The main analyses I'm interested in are:1. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, etc.) for each anatomical feature, broken down by taxonomic group and geological formation.2. Principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of morphological variation within and among taxa.3. Phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the specimens, based on their morphological data.I'd also like to be able to visualize the data in various ways, such as scatterplots, histograms, and phylogenetic trees.Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information. I'm happy to provide more details about my research and the geological context of the specimens.Thanks again for your help, and I look forward to working with you on this project!Best regards,Emily Johnson",research,No

518,220,"Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairwaybut that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with thevariance.  I appreciate your efforts.By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?Bob----- Original Message -----Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AMBob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, Ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea.I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas.Phillip      -----Original Message-----          Sent:   Monday, November 12, 2001 11:45 AM                - Allen 8855 Merlin lttr.doc << File: Allen 8855 Merlin lttr.doc >>**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

Everett, I am asking for your input as it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened : a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately (his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected targets.   b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server Agreement  c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS services (Bob's first negotiation position).    d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in the EBS Server Spend amount.      Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and hardware in 2000  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million for servers and hardware in 2000  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 1999  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional services (costs for Server deployment) From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the following might occur  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $408,000  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount is $4,134,229. (I did not concede)  e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship - they verbally agreed to pay. Now with the above information - my offered next steps : a) Until everything is done - maintain the ""stick"" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 million).  This is being done. b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee (again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income.  c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier relationship.    So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.

540,2337,"<email>Jessica,Thank you for reaching out! I'm so glad you enjoyed my presentation. Your talk on environmental factors affecting health was eye-opening, and I've been thinking about the potential connections between our fields as well.I have considered the environmental impact of dental products, but I haven't had the opportunity to delve into it deeply. I would be very interested in collaborating with you on a project exploring this topic. It's an area that deserves more attention, and I believe our combined expertise could lead to some valuable insights.I'm happy to set up a call to discuss our ideas further and see how we can move forward with this.

542,2437,"<email>Hi Emily,It's great to hear from you! I've also been thinking a lot about our conversation at the conference, and I'm excited to explore potential collaborations between our fields.I completely agree that there is a lot of potential for archaeological research to inform the design and siting of urban green spaces. In fact, I'm currently working on a project that uses GIS data to map the location of archaeological sites in relation to urban green spaces in Albuquerque. I think this approach could be valuable for your work in Portland as well.I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss this further. How about next Friday at 11am MST/10am PST? Let me know if that works for you.Best,Alex",research,No
543,821,"Kirk,I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.Phillip -----Original Message-----Sent:	Tuesday, September 25, 2001 4:10 PMGentlemenPlease take  a look at the attached document.

Agree - ProductsRally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very early). SOme things to consider :1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and be in full blown gasoline season.- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU3- nobody will pay any attention to HO2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly build slower than last year 4- therefore by September everyone will freak out5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar to NG) that the world will not end.Where does this get us:1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise)2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-janNg-Disagree:I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there.

571,2063,"<email>Hi Alex,Your email got me really excited about our upcoming meeting and potential presentation! I love all three of your ideas, but I think the second one, ""Engaging Students through Unconventional Teaching Methods,"" might be the most accessible and engaging for our audience. We could each share a few examples from our own classrooms and then discuss the broader implications for interdisciplinary collaboration.As for meeting up, I've reached out to a couple of my colleagues who I think would be really interested in our work. They're both passionate about innovative teaching methods and have experience with cross-curricular projects. Would you be available for dinner on the Friday evening of the conference? We could have a more casual conversation and brainstorm some ideas for moving forward.I'm looking forward to seeing you soon!Jordan",research,No

573,1014,"Johnnie,Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.Please email your cost estimates when complete.Thank you,Phillip Allen",corporate,Yes

It provides a unique perspective on the economic factors leading up to the Civil War.

In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you want to discuss.Andrew Fairley03/13/2001 11:14 AM  JohnRedmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas.We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the strategy you mentioned below. Once again, thanks for your helpAll the best,AndyJohn Arnold21/02/2001 04:26  Andy:Enjoyed meeting with you.  One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.JohnAndrew Fairley02/20/2001 11:15 AMNeal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ect David Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT Thank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable.

Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them for all the locations.The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol curves from historical data.I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price curves for NG and all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers based on these curves:     5/30/00  5/31/00AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which would give more weight to recent data.We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.Tanya.John Arnold06/07/2000 07:40 AM  Tanya:On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.  I was under the impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received any response.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.

Hydrogen is a fascinating element with many important applications, and I'd be happy to help you design an engaging unit for your students.One activity that I've found effective is a hands-on demonstration of hydrogen production using electrolysis. Students can use a simple setup with water, electrodes, and a power source to generate hydrogen gas, which they can then collect and observe. This helps them understand the process of electrolysis and the properties of hydrogen gas.Another important aspect to cover is the role of hydrogen in renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells. You could introduce the concept of hydrogen fuel cells and discuss their potential as clean energy sources. There are many online resources and videos that showcase how fuel cells work and their applications in various industries.Lastly, I recommend incorporating some historical context by discussing the discovery of hydrogen and its significance in the development of chemistry. This can help students appreciate the importance of the element and its impact on scientific progress.I'd be happy to lend you some resources and demonstration materials if you'd like.

Period.7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net Works' folks are concerned.In the ""I don't want any surprises"" mode, I thought I'd give George a heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team (""I don't see a problem here...""), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for ""credit"", which any ENE business unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were likely to encourage Crowder to ""lean on"" Philippe (which I had recommended against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the veryviabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share undereithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under CompanyA,and so on.     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine thepricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the explorationprojectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over priceoffersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?     $______ per/share",student,No

637,230,"Pam,Can you help with below?David -----Original Message-----Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 11:18 AMDavid,For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip   -----Original Message-----Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AMCc:	Whalley, Greg; Joyce, MaryFor purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.        Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",student,No

651,2071,"<email>Hi Mark,I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about ways to incorporate more real-world applications into my math lessons, and I thought of you and your civic education classes. Would you be interested in collaborating on a project where my students use coding to simulate a democratic election, and your students learn about the math behind voting systems?I think it could be a great way for our students to learn from each other and see how different subjects can work together. Let me know what you think!Best,Samantha",research,No

666,2382,"<email>Emily,I think your lesson plan outline sounds great! Starting with the historical context and then introducing the Enigma machine and its significance is a good way to engage the students and provide them with the necessary background information.I can definitely create some encrypted messages for the students to decipher using modular arithmetic and congruences. We can even make it a competition or a team activity to see who can crack the code first!One suggestion I have is to maybe include a brief explanation of how the Enigma machine works and its inner workings. I think the students would find it interesting to see the actual machine and understand the mechanical and mathematical principles behind it.Let me know if you need any help with the historical aspects of the lesson plan as well. I'd be happy to assist in any way I can.Best,Alex",research,No

This would really help set the stage for their visit and get them excited about what they'll be seeing.Additionally, I've been thinking more about incorporating mindfulness and meditation practices into my teaching, as we discussed before.

668,1999,"<email>Jordan,I'm glad the timing works for you and your students. I'll see you on Tuesday!Your lesson plan on the different roles in space missions sounds fantastic. I'd be happy to share my perspective and discuss how amateur astronomers can contribute to the space exploration community. In fact, I've been involved in a few citizen science projects where amateur astronomers collaborate with professional researchers to analyze data and make discoveries. I think this could be a great way to show your students that they don't have to be professional scientists to make a difference in the field.I'll also share some stories about the incredible women and men who work on missions like Juno, highlighting the diverse backgrounds and skill sets that come together to make these missions possible. I think this could help your students see themselves in these roles and inspire them to pursue their passions in STEM.If you're interested, I could also bring my telescope to school one evening and give your students a hands-on experience observing the night sky. It would be a great way to cap off our discussion and give them a tangible connection to the wonders of space.Let me know what you think about these ideas, and if there's anything else I can do to support your lesson plan.Best,Alex",research,No

I believe this could be a great opportunity to showcase our interdisciplinary collaboration and share our findings with the academic community.Would you be available for a meeting next week to discuss these topics further? I'd love to get your input and brainstorm some ideas together.Best regards,Emily",research,No

Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   Thanks,Dave",student,No

690,2102,"<email>Dear Elena,Thank you for reaching out, and apologies for the delayed response. Your research on the Alaska Purchase and its connection to the philosophical ideas of the time is fascinating. I would be delighted to discuss this further and explore the potential for collaboration.I believe that the works of Spinoza, Hobbes, and Machiavelli could indeed have had a significant influence on the decision-making processes of the key figures involved in the purchase. Spinoza's ideas on the nature of the state and the role of reason in politics, Hobbes' concept of the social contract, and Machiavelli's pragmatic approach to power dynamics could all provide valuable insights into the motivations and strategies employed by the Russian and American negotiators.I have a few resources that might be helpful for your research, and I would be happy to share them with you. Additionally, I think that our collaboration could lead to a compelling joint paper that explores the intersection of philosophy and history in this specific context. We could potentially present our findings at the upcoming interdisciplinary conference on ""Philosophy and History: Reexamining the Past Through Multiple Lenses.""Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal, and if you're available for a meeting to discuss the project further.Best regards,David Spinelli",research,No

It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.

We've made some great progress, but we're facing a few challenges that I think we should discuss.First, the good news: we've secured the grant funding we needed to get the program off the ground! The grant committee was impressed with our proposal and the potential impact our program could have on students with and without disabilities.However, now that we're in the implementation phase, we're running into some scheduling conflicts. It's been difficult to find a time when both our schools can have students available for the program. I was wondering if you had any ideas for how we could work around this issue.Another challenge we're facing is finding volunteers to help with the program. We need people who are knowledgeable about adaptive sports and can assist our students during practices and games.

731,8,"---------------------- 04:57 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.

732,1476,"John,Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the plant, so that wouldn't help. Second, it seems there are more of these ""portable pipeline"" units floating around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas (in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the pipeline system in California. This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested in looking further into transporting LNG into California. Assuming that we could get a few ""portable pipelines"" and some trucks, there are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage (gal) Storage (mmcf)Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2Totals         26.48Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with LNG fleet owners.

Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -814th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three weeks by 15 bcf.  Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment.

Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My pointon v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarilytrade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makesequilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think kcash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yetthat's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to getthere k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer willbe exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than lastyear.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers areselling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are tellingtheir customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/zspreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in thereright mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primaryjuice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm aseller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.

It would be a good way for the students to practice their critical thinking and argumentation skills.I was thinking we could have the students debate topics such as:1. The morality of using animals for food, clothing, and medical research2. The role of individual responsibility vs. government regulation in environmental protection3. The impact of cultural traditions on animal welfare practicesWhat do you think? Do you have any other ideas for debate topics?I'm also thinking about how we can incorporate some non-traditional teaching methods into the course. Maybe we could have the students do a field trip to a local farm or wildlife sanctuary, or invite guest speakers from different cultural backgrounds to share their perspectives on environmental and animal welfare issues.Let me know your thoughts!Best,Jordan",research,No

743,2961,"---------------------- 01:32 PM ---------------------------   				  Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

748,1511,"Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   				 Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ",corporate,Yes

I've reviewed it and think you've done an excellent job outlining our goals and the potential impact of the game-based learning tool.Regarding the game mechanics, I was thinking about incorporating some sort of reward system where children earn points or badges for completing certain tasks or reaching milestones in their hearing management. This could help motivate them to stay engaged with the game and reinforce positive habits.I'd also like to explore ways to make the game adaptive, so that it can adjust the difficulty level based on the child's progress and individual needs. This could help ensure that the game remains challenging and effective for a wide range of children with different abilities and learning styles.Let me know what you think about these ideas, and if you have any other suggestions for making the game as effective and engaging as possible.Best,Michael",research,No

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

773,71,"i'll pay a grand total of 0""Eva Pao"" <epao@mba2002.hbs.edu> on 05/10/2001 05:15:59 PMPlease respond to <epao@mba2002.hbs.edu>   Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number atthe end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under eithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the pricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration projectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.

I agree that combining our research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic and social factors leading to the Civil War.Your suggestion to start by outlining the main differences between the North and the South is a great idea. We could then delve into the specific issues, such as the slave economy, industrialization, and westward expansion, and how these factors heightened tensions between the two regions.I think it would also be valuable to discuss the role of politics in exacerbating these divisions, such as the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act.If you're agreeable, I can start working on an outline for the presentation, focusing on the economic aspects, and you can tackle the social factors. We can then combine our work and refine it together.Let me know if you have any other ideas or suggestions. I'm looking forward to working with you on this project.Best,Michael",research,No

I'll draft up a short version and send it your way for feedback.I also had an idea for a interactive activity we could do with the audience during the presentation. Since our research emphasizes the importance of spending time in nature, we could have attendees pair up and share their favorite outdoor activities or memories. This could help reinforce our message and create a more memorable experience for everyone.Let me know what you think about this idea, and if you have any other suggestions for making our presentation even more impactful.

829,1098,"---------------------- 04:57 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.

The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

The biggest challenge was getting the two systems to communicate effectively, especially when it came to system calls and process management. I can share some of the strategies we used to overcome those hurdles.I'm free for a call later this week if you'd like to discuss the specifics of your project. Just let me know what day and time work best for you.On a separate note, I noticed you mentioned a recent hiking trip. I'm an avid hiker myself!

838,2117,"<email>Hi Emily,I love the idea! I think it's a great way to get students to think about physics concepts in a new and creative way, and it's a perfect opportunity for them to expand their vocabulary at the same time. I'm definitely on board to collaborate with you on this project.I was thinking we could have the students work in small groups and give them a list of physics concepts and vocabulary words to choose from. That way, they can collaborate and bounce ideas off each other, and we can make sure that each group is working on a different concept and set of words.We could also have them present their stories or poems to the class and explain how they incorporated the physics concept and vocabulary words. That would give them a chance to practice their presentation skills and get feedback from their peers.Let me know what you think about these ideas, and we can start planning out the details of the project. I'm excited to work on this with you!Best,Michael",research,No

845,1056,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip",corporate,Yes

I appreciate the thoroughness of your outline and the clear connections you've made between the scientific concepts and their real-world applications.As I was reviewing the syllabus, I had a few thoughts on how we could incorporate more social studies and civic engagement elements into the course. I'd like to see if we can find ways to encourage students to critically examine the societal implications of the scientific advancements we'll be discussing, and to consider their own roles and responsibilities as citizens in relation to these issues.For example, we could include case studies or discussion prompts that ask students to evaluate the ethical and social implications of certain scientific discoveries or technologies. We could also invite guest speakers from various fields (e.g., policy makers, activists, industry professionals) to share their perspectives and engage in dialogue with the students.I'm happy to discuss these ideas further and work with you to revise the syllabus accordingly.

I am delighted to learn about your work on the influence of Chinese philosophy on Faulkner's writing, and I would be happy to share my insights on the twenty-four solar terms and their potential symbolic significance.Your focus on the ""eternal return"" and the cyclical nature of the seasons resonates with the core principles of the solar terms, which divide the year into 24 periods based on the sun's position and the lunar calendar. Each solar term represents a distinct phase in the seasonal cycle and is associated with specific agricultural and cultural practices.I would be particularly interested in discussing the ways in which Faulkner may have engaged with these ideas, either directly or indirectly, and how they might manifest in his use of seasonal imagery and themes. Perhaps we could explore the connection between the solar terms and the structure of some of his works, such as the cyclical narrative in ""The Sound and the Fury.""I am also intrigued by the possibility of co-authoring a paper or presenting at a conference together, as our research interests seem to complement each other nicely.

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the GreatLakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for coldPolar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states bydays 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian andEuropean continue more troughing in the southern branch in theSouthwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continuedridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keepingthem warmer and away from the cold.

Handouts on the key instructional strategies and sample lesson/unit plans will be incredibly helpful for teachers. And I love the idea of incorporating interactive elements like role-playing and practice sessions. I think that will really help the teachers feel more confident and prepared to implement the curriculum.You're welcome to take the lead on creating those training materials. I'll make sure the schools have the space and technology we need for those interactive components.I heard back from both Jefferson and Washington - they're both on board to participate in the pilot!

Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team have requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringing resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After several unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant category.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and today American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably a good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.  I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would work?

I'm looking forward to our discussion and the opportunity to brainstorm ideas for our project.Your suggestion to review the current literature on permafrost stability and planetary volcanism is an excellent starting point. I'll gather the latest research on permafrost and its implications for Earth's climate, and I'll be sure to include any relevant studies on other planets as well.Thank you for the papers you've attached. I've skimmed through them, and they're incredibly informative. Your work on Io's volcanism is truly groundbreaking, and I can already see potential connections with permafrost research.As for potential outlets, I agree that the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets and the Journal of Earth Science would be excellent choices. I also have a contact at the International Journal of Astrobiology who might be interested in our work, given the potential implications for life on other planets.I'm attaching a few papers on permafrost degradation and its impact on Earth's climate. I thought they might provide valuable context for our project.I'm eager to dive into this research and see where our collaboration leads us. Talk to you next Tuesday!Best regards,Liam",research,No

945,2346,"<email>Dear Dr. Chen,It was great meeting you at the Global Health Conference last week. I really enjoyed our conversation about the potential link between WASH interventions and obesity prevention in developing communities. I've been thinking more about the ideas we discussed and would love to explore them further.I did some research and found a few articles that support our hypothesis. For example, [this study](https://www.example.com/study) found that children in communities with poor sanitation were more likely to be stunted and have higher rates of obesity later in life. I think this could be a great starting point for our collaboration.What do you think about conducting a joint research project on this topic? We could potentially do a study in one of the communities where WASH for All is already working. Let me know if you're interested, and we can set up a call to discuss further.Best regards,Sarah",research,No

What is going on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.

1014,771,"jeff,Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.  Phillip -----Original Message-----Sent:	Tuesday, June 19, 2001 5:11 PMSensitivity:	ConfidentialPLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff",corporate,Yes

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec Nymex.  Any ideas?",corporate,No

1045,2,"---------------------- 02:16 PM ---------------------------Richard Burchfield10/06/2000 06:59 AM Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PM Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada.

This is a big blow to the program, especially given her expertise on coastal communities and climate change. Any thoughts on who we could approach as a replacement on such short notice? I'm thinking we should try to find someone who can speak to the human impacts of rising sea levels, to keep with our theme.Also, I heard back from the city council about our request for a permit for the field trip to the coastal restoration site. They're supportive but want us to provide more details on our safety plan, given the recent storms. I can draft something up, but let me know if you have any specific ideas.Thanks,Emily",research,No
1065,2448,"<email>Dear Emily,It's great to hear from you! I remember our engaging conversations at the Global Health Conference and am glad to see that you're making progress on your CLTS project in Cambodia.Regarding the community engagement challenges you're facing, I can certainly empathize. Mobilizing communities to take collective action is often one of the most difficult aspects of implementing CLTS projects. Based on my experience, a few strategies that have proven effective include:1. Identifying and engaging local champions who can help spearhead the initiative and inspire their neighbors to take action.2. Conducting participatory workshops that allow community members to actively discuss the issue of open defecation and its health implications, rather than simply delivering lectures.3. Providing small, tangible incentives for households that build and use latrines, such as seeds or tools, to encourage early adopters and create a sense of momentum.I recently returned from a field visit to a CLTS project in Laos, which employed many of these strategies with great success. I can put you in touch with the local NGO that led the project if you're interested in learning more about their approach.As for potential partners in Southeast Asia, I can connect you with a few colleagues at UNICEF's regional office who have extensive networks in Cambodia. They may be able to introduce you to local organizations working on WASH issues that could support your project.Please keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or ideas to discuss. I'm always eager to collaborate with passionate WASH advocates like yourself.Best wishes,RajeshDr. Rajesh PatelGlobal WASH SpecialistUNICEF",research,No

1069,2159,"<email>Hi Alex,Thanks for the update on the program. It's great to hear that we got the grant funding! That's a huge accomplishment, and it's a testament to all the hard work we've put into this project.I totally understand the challenges you're facing with scheduling and volunteers. These are issues we'll need to tackle head-on if we want our program to succeed.For the scheduling conflicts, what if we propose a rotating schedule? We could have the program take place at different times on different days, so that it doesn't always fall during the same class period or after school. That way, we might be able to accommodate more students and not conflict with other activities.As for the volunteers, I have a few ideas. First, we could reach out to local colleges and universities with physical education or special education programs. They might have students who are interested in gaining experience working with adaptive sports. We could also try contacting local sports clubs or recreation centers to see if they have any volunteers who would be willing to help out.I think it's important that we have a clear idea of what we're asking volunteers to do and what kind of training or experience they need. We should create a volunteer job description and application form to help us find the right people.I'd love to brainstorm more ideas with you and figure out a game plan for tackling these challenges. Let me know when you're free to chat, and we can set up a call or video conference.Looking forward to continuing this work with you,Jamie",research,No

1090,1550,"Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSSMeeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstormingDate: 12/1/00EnronEBS Attendee:Anthony GilmoreGlobal Strategic Sourcing Attendee: Jeff YoungfleshBristol BabcockKevin FinnanJim GriffethPagosa Energy/Well MasterRob BenderDISCUSSION POINTS:1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy ""unified solutions"" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  this could take a longer term to reach the necessary ""critical status"", due to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network capacity.  (a ""sell-through"" effect for EBS)2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could accelerate to the necessary ""critical status"", bringing to EBS more solutions demand due to the addition of ""sell-to"".  The ""sell-through"" effect would be present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a sales ""channel""), as well as EBS ""sell-to"" BBI & Pagosa for their own internal consumption of bandwidth.ACTION ITEMS:  1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's (Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas well-head).3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) at Bristol and/or Pagosa.3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel opportunity (gas / water analog).5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS ""Enron Intelligent Network""Next Meeting: TBDPlease let me know if I've missed anything.Thank you, JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716	Bender Rob <rebende@earthlink.net>	12/05/2000 08:50 AM		 		 		  Anthony_Gilmore@enron.net		 Dear Jeff:It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith andKevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.

John,I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's.

(etc..)This problem makes it impossible to backtest....Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised.....

1140,1594,"Dave:A couple of issues:1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have in normal trading.2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same error message",corporate,No

As we discussed, I think our interdisciplinary event ""Stargazing and Sustainable Farming: A Night of Science and Wonder"" has the potential to be really engaging and informative for the local community. To get the ball rolling, I've secured the university's observatory as our venue for the stargazing portion of the event. It has a great view of the night sky and plenty of space for attendees. I was thinking we could start the event with a brief presentation on the basics of astronomy and how it relates to our understanding of Earth and its place in the universe.What do you think about having a few interactive stations set up where attendees can learn about sustainable farming practices and see some of the technologies we use in action? We could have a demo of soil moisture sensors, a virtual reality experience of a precision agriculture drone flight, and a hands-on activity where people can plant their own mini herb garden to take home.Let me know your thoughts on this and if you have any other ideas for making the event engaging and memorable for our attendees.

1149,1508,"Thad,Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served:  ""sell with"" (each other); and ""sell through"" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces.These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a ""jumping off point"" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of some of the ""EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use"" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.

I'm really excited to hear about your work with our DHH students and your idea for an arts-focused program for them. I think that's a fantastic concept and could be incredibly impactful.A few initial thoughts:- We could potentially incorporate some visual storytelling and theater elements to help the students express themselves and build confidence. I know a great organization in the city that does really innovative work in this area with kids who are DHH.- Music could be a powerful way to engage the students as well, even if it needs to be adapted. I've seen some cool programs that use vibrations and visual cues to teach music to DHH kids.- It would be great to get some of the students' families involved too, to help them support their child's learning and creativity at home.I'd be really happy to help you brainstorm further and connect you with some other educators and organizations who could be great resources. I think this program has so much potential!Also, I'd be glad to write a letter of support for your grant proposal.

However, I have a few suggestions for the final revisions before we submit it.1. In the introduction, I think we should emphasize the potential impact of our research on combating desertification more clearly. We could mention the recent droughts in the region and how our biodegradable polymers could help mitigate their effects.2. In the methodology section, I suggest we provide more details on the specific types of polymers we plan to use and how they will be synthesized. This will give the reviewers a better understanding of the technical aspects of our project.3. Finally, I think we should add a brief discussion on the potential scalability of our approach and how it could be applied to other regions facing similar issues.Let me know your thoughts on these suggestions.

1171,171,"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray",student,No

I'm attaching a small gift to celebrate - a virtual bottle of Brazilian cachaca. Let's plan to have a virtual celebratory drink soon!Regarding our next project, I've been thinking a lot about the current political climate in Brazil and how it relates to the historical themes we explored in our paper. One idea I had is to examine the role of social movements in shaping democratic institutions and processes in Brazil, particularly in the post-dictatorship era. There has been a resurgence of social activism in recent years, and I think it would be interesting to analyze how these movements are influencing political outcomes.Another idea is to explore the impact of economic inequality on democratic stability in Brazil. As you know, Brazil has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, and there is a growing body of research suggesting that high levels of inequality can undermine democratic institutions. We could examine how economic disparities have shaped political participation, representation, and policy outcomes in Brazil.Let me know what you think of these ideas, or if you have any other suggestions. I'm happy to take the lead on drafting a grant proposal for this project, but I would definitely want to collaborate closely with you on the research design and analysis.I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership and tackling these important research questions together.Cheers,Juliana",research,No

Are there any other asset management targets in the west?---------------------- 01:53 PM ---------------------------Jane M Tholt04/12/2000 08:45 AM  ---------------------- AM ---------------------------Laird Dyer04/12/2000 08:17 AM  Janie,Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Laird",corporate,Yes

I like the idea of engaging students in building mental models and helping them develop a deeper understanding of chemical concepts.I've been thinking about ways to make my lessons more interactive and engaging as well. I recently came across a few websites that offer virtual labs and simulations for chemistry students. I think these could be a great supplement to our regular lab activities and help students visualize some of the concepts we cover in class.Here are a couple of the websites I found:- https://chemcollective.org/- http://www.chemdemos.uoregon.edu/I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on these resources and whether you think they might be useful for our students.It would be great to find some time to chat more about both Modeling Instruction and these virtual labs.

1195,2115,"<email>Olivia,I've reviewed the data and photographs you sent over, and I must say, this is a remarkable discovery! The unique features of this fossil are truly intriguing, and I agree that it has the potential to challenge our current understanding of theropod evolution.However, I have some reservations about classifying it as a new clade or subfamily just yet. The features you've identified, while distinct, could potentially be attributed to individual variation or sexual dimorphism within an existing clade.I think we need to approach this with caution and consider all possible explanations before proposing a new taxonomic classification. We should also consult with other experts in the field to get their input and insights.That being said, I'm excited to delve deeper into this research and explore the implications of your discovery. Let's schedule a call early next week to discuss our strategy and outline the key points we want to address in the paper.I appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication to this project.

Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program.

You raise an excellent point about the biochemical aspects of DNA structure and how they might have influenced public perception.As I've been researching the molecular structure of DNA, I've been struck by how the double helix model, with its complementary base pairing, seemed to naturally lend itself to the idea of genetic replication and inheritance. It's fascinating to consider how this relatively simple molecular structure has had such profound implications for our understanding of life and evolution.I think it would be great to include a section in our paper discussing how the biochemical properties of DNA, as they were understood at the time, shaped the public's understanding of the molecule and its role in heredity.

1224,1902,"<email>Hey Emily,Thanks for sharing the script! I've reviewed it and think it's well-structured and informative. One suggestion I have is to include a few more interactive elements, like asking the audience questions or encouraging them to share their thoughts on certain historical events. This could help keep them engaged throughout the presentations.Regarding the audio-visual setup, I've managed to secure most of the equipment we need. However, I think we should consider adding a few more microphones for the Q&A session following the presentations. I'll also work on creating a slideshow with relevant images and videos to complement your script.Let me know if you have any other ideas or concerns, and we can discuss them further.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.

1252,1652,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarDate: 01/20/01 22:15As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

1283,236,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.

1300,2615,"<email>Ariel,Thank you for sharing these ideas. I completely agree that focusing on themes of spiritual longing, divine connection, and personal transformation could be very meaningful for our students. I think you're right that these are questions and struggles that many young adults grapple with, and that the Zohar and other mystical texts can offer powerful insights and guidance.I was thinking about the idea of spiritual longing in particular, and how it can manifest in different ways â€“ as a longing for connection with God, for a sense of purpose and meaning, for a deeper understanding of oneself and one's place in the world. I wonder if we could have our students reflect on their own experiences of spiritual longing, and then explore how different mystical texts and practices can help to address or transform that longing.In terms of specific texts, I'm thinking about some of the Zohar's teachings on the soul and its divine origins, as well as some of the Hasidic stories and teachings about the power of prayer and devekut (cleaving to God). I also think it could be powerful to incorporate some contemplative practices, like meditation or chanting, to give students a direct experience of some of these mystical ideas.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and to keep brainstorming ways to make this unit as engaging and transformative as possible. I'm really excited about the potential of this curriculum to help our students connect more deeply with their Jewish identities and spiritual lives.Best,Jonah",research,No

1316,706,"---------------------- Ray Alvarez@ENRON04/25/2001 11:48 AM	 Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  RayPhillip K Allen@ECT04/25/2001 02:28 PM	 Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

1330,1647,"---------------------- 12:14 PM ---------------------------  George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.

More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Phillip AllenKeith HolstENRON1400 Smith StreetHouston, TX? 77002-7361Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.?Sincerely,[IMAGE]???George W. Richards PresidentP.S.?????

I agree that finding a suitable corpus with economic data from the same regions and time periods will be crucial for our analysis.Regarding the statistical methods, mixed-effects models sound like a good choice, especially since they can handle both fixed and random effects. We could also consider using Bayesian methods, which might allow us to incorporate prior knowledge about the relationships between economic and linguistic variables.I have a few ideas for potential corpora we could use, such as historical newspapers or government documents. I'll do some more research on this and send you a list of options.One other thing I wanted to mention is that we should think about how to present our findings to both econometricians and linguists. We'll need to make sure our paper is accessible to readers from both fields, which might mean explaining some of the more technical aspects of our analysis in a clear and concise way.Looking forward to continuing our collaboration!Best,Javier",research,No

The topic of the influence of Roman water management systems on Asian garden designs is indeed fascinating and not widely explored.From my research, I can tell you that the Romans were highly skilled in hydraulic engineering, and their techniques for moving and controlling water were unparalleled at the time. They built aqueducts, fountains, and even intricate plumbing systems that allowed for the precise control of water flow.It's entirely possible that these techniques were adopted and adapted in other cultures, including in the garden designs of China, Korea, and Japan. I've seen some evidence of similar water control features in Asian gardens, such as the use of channels and water wheels to circulate water.I'd be happy to delve deeper into this topic and provide you with more detailed information and resources. I'll also look through my archives for any relevant papers or articles that could be useful for your research.I'd love to see the photos you took of the Roman aqueducts in Italy.

1379,2877,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million Land      1.15 Interim Financing     .85 Common Areas       .80 Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.

Phillip AllenKeith HolstENRON1400 Smith StreetHouston, TX? 77002-7361Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.?Sincerely,[IMAGE]???George W. Richards PresidentP.S.?????

Creating a calming and peaceful environment is crucial for the well-being of expectant mothers, and I'm glad you recognize the importance of acoustics in achieving that goal.Based on the information you provided, I have a few initial recommendations:1. Sound-absorbing materials: Incorporating sound-absorbing materials such as acoustic panels, bass traps, and carpeting can help reduce echo and reverberation, creating a more peaceful environment.2.

But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and haddesignated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, sotoday he released this one.The Killeen post office (Harker Heights, a suburb) is one of the best wehave had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friendof ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turndown two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract.I'm sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and cansupply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me knowsoon...we will need to act quickly! With best regards, Jim Wills - Harker Heights.doc << File: Harker Heights.doc >>",corporate,Yes

1441,2464,"<email>Hi David,I love your ideas for the chemistry component! Focusing on the periodic table, chemical bonding, and basic chemical reactions is perfect for this age group and will give them a solid foundation for understanding more advanced concepts in the future. The idea of having them build elements and simulate reactions in Minecraft is brilliant â€“ it's engaging, interactive, and really drives home the concepts in a way that's fun and memorable.In terms of learning objectives and outcomes, I think we should aim for the students to:1. Gain a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and variables.2. Understand the structure of the periodic table and be able to identify key elements and their properties.3. Grasp the basics of chemical bonding and how different elements interact to form compounds.4. Apply their programming skills to create a game or simulation that demonstrates a chemistry concept they've learned.I think if we can achieve these objectives, we'll have done a great job of introducing these subjects to the students and inspiring them to explore further.What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions or modifications you might have. I'm also happy to take the lead on the programming component if you'd like to focus on the chemistry side of things.Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!Best,Emily",research,No

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  RayPhillip K Allen@ECT04/25/2001 02:28 PM  Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

1453,2817,"<email>Hi Mike,It's great to hear from you! I'm glad the resources I shared have been helpful. I completely understand the struggle of having players who are struggling with fundamental technical skills. It can be really frustrating, especially when it's impacting the team's performance. Based on my research, one thing that can be effective is providing a lot of augmented feedback, especially in the early stages of learning a new skill. This means giving specific, skill-related feedback very frequently during practice. So for dribbling, you might provide feedback on things like the angle of their foot, the pace they're dribbling at, their body positioning, where they're looking, etc. Research has shown that this type of frequent, specific feedback can really accelerate learning.Another thing to consider is the structure of your practices. Block practice, where players repeat the same skill over and over, is often less effective than random or variable practice, where they're switching between different but related skills. So for example, instead of having them just dribble in straight lines for 20 minutes, you might have them dribble in different patterns, pass the ball to each other, do 1v1 drills, etc. The cognitive demand of switching between tasks can actually help with learning.I've attached a couple articles that go into more detail on these concepts that you might find useful.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to support you. And keep me posted on how it goes with your team!Best,Emily",research,No

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials.Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900.Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500.We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063.Have a good one and take with you later.Sincerely,Mel Nelson",Other,No

1476,2086,"<email>Dear Finn,I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding a fascinating Neolithic burial site I've been studying here in the Orkney Islands. As you know, the islands are rich in archaeological treasures, and this particular site has captured my attention due to its unique features and potential connection to a nearby volcanic eruption.I was wondering if you might be willing to share your expertise in volcanology to help me better understand the geological context of the site. I believe that your insights could greatly enhance my research and provide valuable information about how the eruption may have affected the ancient population.If you're interested in collaborating, I would be more than happy to share my findings with you and discuss the project in more detail. I'm particularly eager to learn more about the specific volcanic event that occurred in the region and how it might have influenced the burial practices of the Neolithic people.Please let me know if you have any availability to discuss this further. I'm excited about the potential of this project and believe that our combined expertise could lead to some groundbreaking discoveries.Best regards,Eleanor",research,No

1482,1459,"David and Bob,We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities (storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues.  EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those changes are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 on or before December 31,2000.   2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Your suggestion for the workshop structure sounds fantastic.

Perhaps we could have participants work in small groups to apply a technique to a hypothetical student profile. This would allow them to practice the strategy and discuss their thoughts with their peers.As for travel, I haven't booked my flights yet, but I'm planning to do so this week.

1487,1454,"Chaz and Steve,Here's the latest, in a nutshell.  Basically, the testing is not fully completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the purchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at EBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC purchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to me.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your deal done.  The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from yesterday still apply.Thank you,Jeff----- 	Douglas Cummins@ECT	12/15/2000 04:14 PM				 		  		 Jeff,We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's solution is a better one for us.My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.  I believe Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, before making a decision.Regards,Douglas",corporate,No

1503,2118,"<email>Hey Amina,I hope you're doing well! I just came across this article about NASA's latest discovery on Mars, and I thought you might find it interesting. It seems they've found evidence of an ancient lakebed that could have once supported life. I know you're always looking for ways to make your science lessons more engaging, so I was wondering if this could be something you could incorporate into your curriculum? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you could use this information to capture your students' imaginations.Looking forward to catching up soon!Best,Chidi",research,No

Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. Oil PoliticsOPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.",corporate,No

1516,1401,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip",corporate,Yes

1519,2493,"<email>Dear Emily,Thank you for sending over the platform overview. I had a chance to review the document and must say that I am impressed by the thoughtfulness and comprehensiveness of your approach to teaching digital literacy and online safety to young learners.Based on the information provided, I have a few initial thoughts and questions to discuss during our call:1. User Roles and Access Control: Given the various user types (students, teachers, parents) and the need for different access levels, we should consider implementing a role-based access control system within the database.2. Data Security: As the platform deals with sensitive user information, particularly that of minors, we must prioritize data encryption, secure authentication mechanisms, and regular security audits.3. Scalability and Performance: To accommodate the platform's growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we should design the database with scalability in mind, considering options like sharding or partitioning.4. Progress Tracking and Analytics: To effectively track user progress and provide valuable insights, we may need to implement a separate analytics database that can handle complex queries and reporting.I look forward to discussing these points and any other requirements or concerns you may have during our call on Tuesday.Best regards,David ThompsonDatabase Developer, DataDeveloper.io",research,No

Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.

1533,2850,"<email>Dear Michael,I hope you're doing well. I've just finished reviewing the feedback we received on our curriculum draft from our colleagues. Overall, I think the response has been quite positive, but there are a few areas where I believe we could make some improvements.First, I think we need to spend more time in the introductory chapter explaining the importance of understanding the U.S. political system and how it impacts our daily lives. Several reviewers mentioned that this would help engage students from the beginning.Second, I think we could benefit from including more real-world examples and case studies throughout the curriculum. This would help illustrate the concepts we're teaching and make the material more relatable to students.Lastly, I think we should consider adding a chapter on the role of media in politics. This is a topic that is becoming increasingly important, and I think our students would benefit from a deeper understanding of how media influences the political landscape.What do you think about these suggestions? I'm happy to take the lead on incorporating them into the next draft if you agree. Let me know if you have any other ideas or feedback.Best regards,Emily",research,No
1534,2204,"<email>Olivia,I like your idea of mixing narrative storytelling with expert interviews. It could help us provide a more well-rounded perspective on each topic. We could reach out to some of the historians we've cited in our blog posts and see if they'd be interested in participating.For the social media campaign, I think creating teaser videos and graphics is a great idea. We could also do a countdown to the launch date and share some behind-the-scenes content to build anticipation. Offering a sneak peek to our email subscribers is a fantastic way to incentivize sign-ups and create a sense of exclusivity.I'm available for a call this Friday at 2 PM EST.

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",student,No

It sounds like you are making the most of this incredible opportunity.Regarding the ritual of ""X,"" you raise an excellent question. The conflicting interpretations you mention are indeed a topic of debate among scholars.

1564,1857,"---------------------- 01:09 PM ---------------------------   				Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",corporate,Yes

I have a few minor suggestions for further revisions, which I'll send your way in a separate email.Regarding conferences, I think the Western History Association and the Latin American Studies Association are excellent options. I have a colleague who presented at the WHA last year and had a great experience. LASA might be a good choice as well, given the focus on Latin American Studies.I've also been giving some thought to the idea of expanding our project into a book.

1587,1046,"Reagan,Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a list of questions on the specs:1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to call Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.PhillipI",corporate,Yes

Ich habe die Ãœbungen durchgesehen und finde sie sehr gut durchdacht. Eine Idee fÃ¼r eine ErgÃ¤nzung: KÃ¶nnten die SchÃ¼ler nachdem sie die Regeln entdeckt haben, einen kleinen Dialog verfassen, in dem sie die gelernten Strukturen verwenden? Das wÃ¤re eine gute MÃ¶glichkeit, das Gelernte zu festigen und zu Ã¼ben.Was authentische Materialien angeht: In diesem Jahr haben wir uns auf deutsche Musik konzentriert. Die SchÃ¼ler haben Lieder gehÃ¶rt, die Texte analysiert und die Handlung gezeichnet. Das hat sehr gut funktioniert, besonders mit Liedern von Mark Forster und Helene Fischer. Vielleicht probierst du das ja auch einmal aus.Ich wÃ¼rde mich auch sehr freuen, wenn du mir einige authentische Ressourcen empfehlen kÃ¶nntest, die du in deinem Unterricht verwendet hast und von denen du denkst, dass sie meinen Studenten gefallen kÃ¶nnten.

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.

We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November loads.Let me know what you think.Phillip,student,No
1627,2354,"<email>Dear Linda,I hope you're doing well. I wanted to update you on Sarah Thompson's case. As you know, we've been closely monitoring her gestational diabetes throughout her pregnancy. Unfortunately, her condition has worsened, and I believe it's in the best interest of both Sarah and the baby to induce labor early.I've discussed the risks and benefits of induction with Sarah, and she has agreed to the procedure. Can you please schedule some time with her to go over the induction process in more detail and answer any questions she may have?Also, please make sure she understands the importance of monitoring her blood sugar levels closely during the induction process and after delivery. We'll need to keep a close eye on both her and the baby in the hours and days following the birth.Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Best regards,Dr. Emily Johnson",research,No

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""",corporate,No

1645,2428,"<email>Hi David,I would be absolutely thrilled to collaborate with you on this project! It sounds like a fantastic opportunity to bring together our different areas of expertise and potentially make some groundbreaking discoveries.I'm happy to help with the remote sensing and geospatial analysis components of the research. I have a lot of experience working with satellite imagery and GIS data for monitoring mangrove ecosystems, and I think we could use similar approaches to study the fossil sites you mentioned.I'm also very interested in the idea of co-authoring a paper on the broader implications of our findings for understanding the intersections between human evolution and environmental change. I think this could be a really exciting direction for our collaboration.Let's set up a time to discuss the grant application and start putting together a plan for the research trip. I'm attaching a draft of a project proposal that I've been working on that might be relevant to our discussions.I can't wait to get started on this collaboration!Best,Emily",research,No
1646,2570,"<email>Jordan,It's great to hear from you! I'd be happy to offer some tips for staying healthy while traveling in Vietnam. The key is mostly just being very careful about the water - always drink bottled or boiled water, and avoid raw or undercooked foods from street vendors. I can send you a list of my favorite restaurants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City that I trust.I'm really intrigued by your research into early Protestant missions and would love to learn more. In my work, I've found some evidence that the spread of certain parasites may have been influenced by the migration patterns of different religious groups, so I think our areas of study could definitely inform each other. I'd be interested in getting your thoughts on how the religious practices and diets of those early missionaries might have impacted the local food systems.I'm traveling for a conference next week but I'd be glad to set up a call the week after, if that works for you? Let me know your availability.Best,Linh",research,No
1647,1433,"Jennifer, This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS with.  In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend projections, he had the ""Professional Services"" highlighted with a bunch of question marks.  It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ $2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day.  Either way, it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works).

How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  $4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?

Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten (PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the contract at this point.  I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness of the BMC flexibility w/regard to ""purchase commitment"", etc.  In addition, I have re-iterated the time urgency.I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call me back.Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?

It could be really enriching for them to hear from an expert in the field.What do you think about organizing an art exhibition at the end of the project to showcase their work?

It's fascinating to see the connections between the linguistic roots of words related to paper and folding in Old English and Proto-Germanic languages.

I think you'll find it interesting to see how many of these terms have roots in Japanese culture and have been adapted or adopted into the English language.I've also included a few resources on the history of origami and its influence on Japanese art and culture. I hope these will provide valuable context for your research.As for our discussion, I'm available next Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, if either of those times work for you.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PM Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada.

1664,5,"---------------------- 01:09 PM ---------------------------   				Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",student,No

1673,1526,"I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week.   				  John(s),How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

I'm worried I'm not tough enough for this job.I don't mean to dump all my angst on you, I just don't know many other teachers as innovative as you who could relate. Do you ever feel this way?

I can't wait to see the data and specimens you've collected.Please send over any relevant information, and let's set up a time to discuss our approach for the paper. I'm confident that with our combined expertise, we can make a significant contribution to the field.Looking forward to working with you on this exciting project!Best,Liam",research,No

We have masked  the rows and columns with missing values, However since our way of masking out is slightly more complicated , therefore may take more time incase of larger matrices. Hence using the code on Stackoverflow would be beneficial. Also, the code provided on Stack-Overflow is only for the case of non-negative least squares, so needs to be used accordingly.",student,No

1698,2133,"<email>Alex,Thanks so much for sending those resources! I've been reading through them and they're really inspiring. I love the idea of creating a lesson together that we could co-teach. I was thinking we could focus on the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities and tie that into a lesson on climate science and the greenhouse effect. We could have students analyze data on climate impacts in different communities and discuss the historical and social factors that contribute to these disparities.I'd be happy to come up with a draft outline for the lesson and send it your way. Then we can bounce ideas back and forth and refine it together.Excited to collaborate on this!Sam",research,No

I've also been digging into FinStealer and have found some additional information that I think will be helpful in our efforts to combat this malware.I've reached out to a few of my contacts in the cybersecurity community, and it seems that FinStealer has been responsible for several high-profile breaches in the past few months. The attackers behind the malware are believed to be a sophisticated criminal organization with ties to Eastern Europe.I'll put together a summary of what I've learned and share it with you before our meeting tomorrow. We'll need to develop a comprehensive strategy to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of FinStealer on our clients' systems.Looking forward to working with you on this, Emily.

It's always a pleasure to connect with someone passionate about exploring the intersection of game design and economics.I'd be happy to share some insights and resources with you. One key concept to understand is the role of incentives and rewards in driving player behavior. By carefully designing the economic systems within your game, you can encourage players to engage in desired actions and create a sense of progression and achievement.Some resources that might be helpful for you include:1. ""The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses"" by Jesse Schell - This book provides a comprehensive overview of game design principles and includes discussions on economics and player motivation.2. ""Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals"" by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman - Another excellent resource that covers the fundamentals of game design, including the role of rules and systems.3.

It is really not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard application. Thanks,Fangming",corporate,No

1757,1719,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.

1764,2158,"<email>Dear Grace,Thank you for reaching out and for the kind invitation to speak to your class. I would be delighted to give a guest lecture on the role of women in early human societies. I think it's crucial for students to understand the deep history of gender roles and how they have evolved over time. I can provide an overview of what the archaeological and fossil evidence tells us about the lives of early human females, and how that compares to modern human societies.I'm happy to work with you to ensure the lecture is appropriate for your students' level and fits well with your curriculum. Please let me know what date and time would work best for you, and if there are any specific topics or themes you'd like me to focus on.Looking forward to collaborating with you on this!Best,Liam",research,No
1765,2622,"<email>Hi David,It was great to meet you at the conference last week and learn more about your work on colonialism in Africa. I was really intrigued by your talk on the economic impact of colonialism and found myself thinking about the ways in which history and mathematics education could intersect.I'm writing to share a bit more about my own research on using data analysis to improve math instruction. I've attached a recent paper I published on the topic. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on how this kind of approach could be applied in history education as well.Looking forward to continuing our conversation and exploring potential collaborations.Best,Emily",research,No

I recently came across a new component that could significantly improve the accuracy of our open-source multimeter project. It's called the ""SuperAccurate ADC"" and it's supposed to have an incredibly low noise floor and high resolution.I was thinking we could try to incorporate this component into our design and see if it makes a noticeable difference in our measurements. What do you think? Have you heard of this component before?Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!Best regards,John",research,No

I wanted to reach out to you regarding our recent discussion about creating a collaborative art project for my kindergarten class based on local historical landmarks. I think this could be a wonderful opportunity for the students to learn about the rich history of our region while also expressing their creativity through art.I was thinking we could focus on the World War I fortifications you spoke about at the historical society meeting. Perhaps you could provide some historical context and photographs of the sites, and I could guide the students in creating paintings or drawings inspired by these landmarks.What do you think? I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we could make this project a success. Please let me know if you're interested in collaborating and if you have any suggestions for other historical sites we could include.Best regards,Marie",research,No

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer.

I've had a chance to read through it and I'm impressed by the depth of research and the compelling connections you've made between ancient Aboriginal adaptations and contemporary coastal management challenges. Your writing style is engaging and clear.I have a few suggestions for further strengthening the paper:1. In the introduction, could you provide a bit more context on the current state of Aboriginal cultural heritage sites threatened by sea level rise? Some specific examples would help ground the discussion.2. In the section on natural adaptation processes, I think we could expand on the role of sediment transport in shaping coastlines. I can provide some additional data from our North Sea studies if that would be helpful.3. I wonder if we could include a brief case study of a modern coastal community that has successfully implemented adaptation strategies informed by ancient knowledge. This could help illustrate the practical applications of our research.Overall, this is a strong start and I'm excited to continue working with you on this important paper.

We can then iterate on the designs until we have a set of visualizations that effectively convey the key findings and concepts in your research.In terms of timeline, I think we should aim to have the initial designs completed within the next month, with time for revisions and final tweaks after that.

1858,255,"---------------------- 02:00 PM ---------------------------Richard Burchfield10/06/2000 06:59 AM Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PM Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.

1863,2036,"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",research,Yes

1867,739,"MichelleHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).SheriWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme.

We decided to refer to the company asboth Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so thatthere is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coachexit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In referenceto your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those werePhillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.Please let me know if you have any questions.(See attached file: RM Simulation - Intro & Scenarios 1-7.doc)Sheri A.

I'm flattered that you value my expertise and believe I could contribute to your textbook on cost-benefit analysis. The idea of collaborating with you is exciting, and I would be happy to discuss it further.I think the conference in Seattle will provide a great opportunity for us to meet and iron out the details of our potential collaboration. I'll be sure to check the conference schedule and find a suitable time for us to meet.As for cycling, I'm definitely up for joining you on a ride! It's been a while since I've had the chance to explore new routes, so I'm looking forward to it.

I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for  around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be  available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.   As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

1925,90,"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution.  third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this helps,johnSharad Agnihotri04/04/2001 12:44 PM  John, MikeI work for the London Research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done some fundamental research regarding the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.I would be grateful if you tell me what you have done or suggest someone else that I could ask.RegardsSharad Agnihtori",student,No

1937,1856,"---------------------- 04:26 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, ""Claudia L. Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer.""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company",corporate,No

I'll also start reaching out to some contacts I have in the music community to see if they'd be interested in participating. The local library or community center sounds like a perfect venue for the exhibition. Thanks for taking the lead on coordinating that! I'll be happy to assist in any way I can. Next Tuesday at 4pm works great for me. I'll look out for the Zoom link. In the meantime, I'll start brainstorming some ideas for the art projects and how we can tie them into our lesson plans. I'm thinking we could have each class choose a different culture and musical genre to focus on, and then have them create a piece of art that represents their interpretation of that culture and music.

1960,1065,"Jacques,I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.

The parallels between the environmental and social challenges faced during the industrial revolution and those we face today are striking, and I believe that exploring these connections can provide valuable insights for your students.If you'd like, we could arrange a call or video conference to discuss your lesson plan in more detail and brainstorm ways to effectively integrate the historical context. I can also provide you with some additional resources, such as primary sources, scholarly articles, and excerpts from Dickens' works that could help bring the subject to life for your students.Please let me know your availability for a discussion, and we can take it from there.

From there, you can explore more specialized resources focusing on the history of Arabic manuscripts and their preservation.I suggest beginning with my beginner's course on ArabicforBeginners.com, which covers the essentials of MSA. Additionally, I recommend the following resources for your specific interests:1. ""The Book of Books: A History of Arabic Manuscripts"" by Yasin Hamid Safadi2.

The initial thought was that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction.

We could compare the results to those from your patient data to see if there's a correlation.I'm happy to take the lead on the lab work if you can provide the patient samples and data. We could then work together to analyze the results and co-author a paper on our findings.Does this sound like a good plan to you? I'm happy to discuss the details further on our call next Tuesday.

2015,2444,"---------------------- 04:35 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.

2028,2207,"<email>Jordan,That's great news about submitting our paper! I'm thrilled that we're one step closer to sharing our research with the wider meteorological community. I completely agree that we should start preparing for the International Meteorological Conference. It would be an incredible opportunity to showcase our work and get input from experts in the field.I think for our presentation, we should definitely highlight the novel aspects of our approach and the potential for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts. We could also discuss some of the challenges we faced during the research process and how we overcame them.On another note, I've been giving some thought to the future of our project, especially in light of the potential budget cuts at the national weather service. I'm worried that our research might be in jeopardy if we don't secure additional funding. Have you had any luck exploring alternative sources of support?Let me know if you want to brainstorm some ideas or if there's anything I can do to help.Best,Liam",research,No

2058,2674,"<email>Dear Emily,Thank you for reaching out! It's a pleasure to meet you, and I'm happy to help with your zoo field trip.I think focusing on the diets of the animals is a great way to make the trip both educational and engaging for your students. One aspect you could highlight is how the zoo works to replicate the natural diets of the animals as closely as possible to support their health and well-being.For example, did you know that many zoos have dedicated nutritionists on staff who work to create balanced diets for each species? They take into account factors like the animals' natural habitat, activity levels, and life stage when determining what to feed them.If you're able to arrange it, a behind-the-scenes tour of the zoo's food preparation facilities could be a fascinating addition to your trip. Seeing the care and attention that goes into preparing the animals' meals might help your students appreciate the importance of a balanced diet for all living things.I recently attended a conference where I heard a presentation on the role of nutrition in animal behavior and welfare. The researchers found that animals who are fed a diet that closely mimics what they would eat in the wild exhibit more natural behaviors and have better overall health outcomes. I can send you the conference proceedings if you're interested in learning more.Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help make your field trip a success.

2064,1470,"David:Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try simulating actual market cicumstances? Savita Puthigai/ENRON@enronXgate John,You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid.Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality.The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases.I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.Dave Program CriteriaThe formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product.Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1.Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04]Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50]Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0].Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50]Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is startedInitial Spread - The Spread used when the program is startedSpread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01]Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.Program OutputsThe program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:Spread (integer) - as per current Stack ManagerOffset (integer) - as per current Stack ManagerSuspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. Normally ""False""Program Interface and Operation PrinciplesThe user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value.Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread-Offset Minimum.GUI/Formulas Example:ConstantsIntensity Factor: [4]Dead Interval: [240]Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]Spread Minimum [0.04]Spread Maximum [0.50]Offset Minimum [0]Offset Maximum [0.49]Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]         INPUTS           OUTPUTSIntensity FormulaFormula # Intensity   Spread Offset  SuspensionS1  >220   -0.01 n/a FS2  <30   +0.01 n/a FS3  <10   +0.02 n/a FTransaction FormulaFormula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  SuspensionV1  <4   n/a -0.01 FV2  >3   n/a +0.01 FV3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 FV4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 FV5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 FV6  >20   n/a n/a T    Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured.In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI.SimulationObviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction, please see the attached:Additional FeaturesSystem NotificationsThere should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.Dave",corporate,No

2074,2584,"<email>Hi Jordan,I'm glad to hear the visual aids were helpful! The periodic table is organized based on the number of protons (also known as the atomic number) in each element. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, with the elements with similar properties being placed in the same column (called a group).Think of it like this: if our cells were arranged based on the number of organelles they contained, and cells with similar functions were grouped together, it would be a bit like the periodic table. The elements in each group have similar properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which determines how they interact with other elements.I hope this helps clarify things! Remember, understanding the periodic table is a key part of understanding chemistry. Keep up the good work and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions.Best,Dr. Chen",research,No

2084,1081,"George,I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million Land      1.15 Interim Financing     .85 Common Areas       .80 Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip",corporate,Yes

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

2138,2931,"Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   				 Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ",research,Yes

(""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.   << File: OEI.xls >>",corporate,No

2165,2544,"<email>Hi Laura,I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you because I recently acquired some fascinating new fossil samples that I think could shed light on the evolution of the Allosauroidea group of theropods. The fossils appear to show some unique anatomical features that I haven't seen before, and I'd love to get your thoughts on their potential implications.Would you be available for a video call next week to discuss these fossils in more detail? I'm hoping to get your expert opinion on how they might fit into our current understanding of allosauroid evolution and what further analyses we might want to pursue.Please let me know if you have any availability next week, and we can set something up. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these exciting new finds!Best regards,Jordan",research,No
2166,2775,"<email>Liam,I'm so glad you're on board with this project! I'll send over the preliminary data and photographs of the fossil specimens later today. I've also been giving some thought to the phylogenetic implications, and I think you'll find the results surprising.Based on the unique features of this fossil, I believe it may challenge some of our current assumptions about theropod diversification during the Cretaceous. It could potentially represent a new clade or subfamily, which would have significant implications for our understanding of theropod evolution.I'm curious to hear your initial thoughts once you've had a chance to review the data. We can then schedule a call to discuss our strategy for the paper and how we want to present our findings.Thanks again for your collaboration on this project. I have a feeling it's going to be a game-changer!Best,Olivia",research,No

2206,2866,"Frank:One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently.  But in the winter that may change.Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South BayPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

I'll be one of your co-presenters at the upcoming science conference in Cusco, Peru.The conference organizers have paired us together to give a joint presentation on the similarities between the extinction of dinosaurs and the current global fight against viral infections. I'm really excited about this interdisciplinary approach and the potential for sparking interesting discussions.As the conference is being held at a high altitude, the organizers have recommended that we arrive a few days early to acclimate. I was wondering if you'd be interested in sharing a room to save on expenses and to get to know each other better before our presentation.

As you might remember, I'm working on my dissertation about William Faulkner's lesser-known works, and I've been granted the opportunity to travel to his hometown in Mississippi to conduct research. I'll have access to some incredible primary sources, but I'm worried about properly archiving and backing up the materials I'll be working with.I know you're the go-to person for all things digital preservation, so I was hoping you could point me in the right direction. What software or tools do you recommend for archiving documents and notes while I'm on the road?

Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing...    as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build the stack now to estimate.  frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really inactive.to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller thoughnot really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.

This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are trying very hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our additional components at the current quote price if we signed.  BMC, Control -MApprox. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for a total of 628 kHardware for either product is approx. 300 k. We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors into BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft (Larry if you have info on this please comment).Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  You guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it will lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% discount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn how over priced their products are !Let me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through or be advised to let it go till the New Year.ThanksBruce*****Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :BMC, Control SA1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for future consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.

We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com",corporate,No

I have some availability this week and would be more than happy to have an extra session with you to go over the material that will be on the test.How about Wednesday afternoon, around 4pm? We can meet in the library like usual. I'll prepare some practice problems and review sheets for the concepts that are likely to be on the test. Please let me know if that works for you. If not, I'm happy to try and find another time that does.I'm rooting for you, Jamie! You've been working hard and I know you'll do great on the test.Best,Emily",research,No

It sounds like a really interesting study, and I'd be happy to take a look at your data and offer any insights I can.I'll definitely be at the GSA conference in Salt Lake City, so let's definitely plan on meeting up. I'm free on the afternoon of the second day of the conference, if that works for you. We could grab lunch at the hotel restaurant and have a good chat about your research.I'm curious to learn more about the statistical methods you've been using to analyze the fossil distribution patterns. It would be great if you could bring along any maps or diagrams that illustrate your key findings so far. I might be able to suggest some additional analytical techniques that could help you refine your interpretations.Looking forward to catching up in person and hopefully sparking some new ideas for our research. See you in Salt Lake City!Best,David",research,No

The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date.    Let me know what you think.

I will compile my findings and share them with you by next Monday.I have also been thinking about the implications of product differentiation in monopolistic competition.

2254,2598,"<email>Dear Rabbi Silverstein,I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you from Jerusalem, where I am currently studying for a semester at the Hebrew University. As you know, I have been deeply immersed in the study of Jewish history and traditions, and I have encountered a question that I believe you may be able to help me with.In my research, I have come across conflicting interpretations of the historical significance of the ritual of ""X."" Some scholars argue that it originated during the Second Temple period, while others claim that it dates back to the time of the Babylonian exile. As I delve deeper into this topic, I find myself unsure of which interpretation to trust.I remember the many insightful discussions we had about Jewish rituals and their origins during my time at the JCC in Chicago, and I am hoping you might be able to shed some light on this matter. If you have any resources, insights, or guidance you could share with me, I would be immensely grateful.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and catching up on how things are going back in Chicago.Best regards,Avraham",research,No

It means a lot coming from someone whose work I greatly admire.I've just sent a calendar invite for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. I look forward to our call and the opportunity to discuss our findings in greater detail.As for a sneak peek, I can share that our discovery revolves around the detection of a previously unknown population of galaxies in the early universe. These galaxies appear to be much more numerous and luminous than previously thought, challenging our current models of galaxy formation and evolution.I'm attaching a figure that illustrates the unexpected luminosity function we've observed. I'd be interested to hear your initial thoughts on the implications of this finding for our understanding of the early universe.See you next Tuesday!Best regards,Alex",research,No

Please feel free to make any suggestions or changes you deem necessary.In the meantime, I will continue to research the latest developments in geothermal energy and machine learning applications to ensure that our proposal is at the cutting edge of the industry.I look forward to our call and the fruitful collaboration ahead.Best regards,John",research,No

I think we should definitely include this information in our patient education materials and discuss it during our counseling sessions.Regarding the meeting with the hospital administration, I agree that we should go over the presentation together. I was thinking we could highlight the potential benefits of our initiative, such as increased vaccine uptake rates, reduced incidence of pertussis among infants, and improved overall maternal and infant health outcomes. We could also emphasize the potential cost savings associated with preventing vaccine-preventable diseases.Let's schedule a time to meet and finalize our presentation.

The strategies you mentioned, particularly identifying local champions and conducting participatory workshops, resonate with me and align with the approach we've been trying to take. We will definitely incorporate the idea of providing small incentives for early adopters â€“ that could be a game-changer in creating momentum within the community.I would be incredibly grateful if you could connect me with the local NGO in Laos. Learning about their successful approach and hearing their stories could provide us with the inspiration and guidance we need to overcome the challenges we're facing.And of course, any introductions you could facilitate with potential partners in Cambodia through your colleagues at UNICEF's regional office would be immensely appreciated. Collaborating with local organizations could help us tap into valuable local knowledge and resources that could make a real difference in our project's impact.I will definitely keep you updated on our progress and will be sure to reach out if any other questions or ideas come up. Thank you again for your support and for being such a valuable resource in the WASH community. I hope we can continue to exchange ideas and perhaps even explore opportunities to collaborate on advancing WASH access in the future.Best regards,EmilyEmily NguyenPublic Health AdvocateWASH Advocates NGO",research,No

2277,766,"Carlos,Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:Sales price:		2,100,000Purchase price		1,200,000Fees&Devel costs	  500,000Profit			 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.  First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen	8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626",corporate,No

2281,835,"Greg,I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.

2282,2294,"<email>Hi Olivia,I've just finished reading the papers you sent over, and I'm impressed by the potential of radar technology for NEO detection. The sensitivity and resolution of modern radar systems are truly remarkable, and I can see how they could be a valuable tool in our efforts to monitor and track potentially hazardous asteroids.I've also been thinking more about the implications of our research for planetary defense. If we can develop a reliable radar-based system for detecting and tracking NEOs, it could significantly improve our ability to predict and mitigate the risks posed by asteroid impacts. This could have a major impact on public policy and international cooperation in the field of space exploration and planetary protection.I'm eager to continue our collaboration and explore the possibilities for a joint research project. I'm available for a call next week, anytime after 2 PM on Tuesday or Thursday. Please let me know what works best for you.Looking forward to our continued partnership!Best regards,Ethan",research,No
2283,1439,"the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnslafontaine@globalp.com on 12/22/2000 07:11:26 AM  Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer.""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company",corporate,No

2300,1636,"Lucy,Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes if you need to.Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records.

2349,2796,"<email>Hi Michael,I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share with you my latest paper on a new statistical method for analyzing the spatial distribution of fossils in rock layers. I think you might find it interesting, given your work in geochronology and paleontology.The paper is titled ""A novel approach to quantifying the spatial structure of fossil assemblages using multi-scale point pattern analysis"" and was just published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. I've attached a copy for your reference.In the paper, I present a new method that combines geo-spatial analysis techniques with statistical tools to identify patterns in the distribution of fossils within rock layers. The method allows for a more detailed understanding of ancient ecosystems and can help us test hypotheses about the environmental factors that influenced the distribution of species in the past.I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on the paper and whether you think this approach could be useful for your own research.

I really like your idea of including interactive 3D models of fossils â€“ it will definitely enhance the learning experience.

2381,2454,"<email>Dear Samuel,Thank you for reaching out, and I'm glad to hear that our discussions at the conference left a lasting impression. Your research on the new species of Salticidae jumping spider with unique mimicry abilities sounds truly remarkable, and I would be very interested in learning more about your findings.The potential link between modern spider behavior and their ancient ancestors is a fascinating area of research, and I believe that our combined expertise could indeed lead to some groundbreaking discoveries. The newly discovered fossil site in Mongolia is an extraordinary opportunity to gather valuable data and specimens that could shed light on the evolutionary history of spider mimicry and communication.I would be delighted to discuss the possibility of a collaboration and the joint grant application in more detail. Perhaps we could set up a video call next week to share our latest research findings and explore the potential for a joint project?Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.Best regards,Evelyn Blackwell, PhDAssociate Professor of PalaeoarachnologyPaleospiders Institute",research,No

2386,2182,"<email>Dear Ms. Johnson,Thank you for reaching out, and I'm delighted to hear about your curriculum project. As someone who is passionate about Acadian history and its role in shaping the unique culture of Louisiana, I would be more than happy to assist you in any way I can.I think it's wonderful that you're incorporating primary sources and historical documents into your lessons. Some excellent resources to consider include:1. The ""Memorial of the French Inhabitants of Louisiana to the King of France"" (1755)2. The ""Treaty of Paris"" (1763)3. First-hand accounts from Acadian deportees during the Grand DÃ©rangement (1755-1764)4. Newspaper articles from the time period discussing the Acadians' plightIn terms of engaging lesson ideas, I've found that role-playing activities, where students take on the perspectives of different historical figures, can be incredibly effective in helping them understand the complexities of the time period.I'm also happy to provide some broader historical context and analysis to help frame the materials you incorporate into your lessons.Please feel free to reach out with any other questions or requests.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

2388,2278,"<email>David,I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some incredible news with you. While digging through the archives at the University of Puerto Rico, I stumbled upon a collection of letters between Puerto Rican independence activists from the late 19th century. The letters discuss the role of genetics in shaping the island's identity and resisting colonial oppression.I immediately thought of our research project and how these letters could provide valuable context for our work. I've attached a few scanned copies of the most relevant letters for you to take a look at.What do you think about incorporating these letters into our study?

It means so much to me to have a trusted colleague and mentor like you to turn to as I navigate this new role.I love your idea of co-authoring an article or presenting at a conference together!

Let's touch base soon to brainstorm some specific ideas and to identify potential outlets or events where we could share our work.In the meantime, I will keep you posted on my progress and will definitely reach out with any questions or updates.

2396,1522,"sureGriffith/Corp/Enron@Enron, Dutch Quigley/HOU/ECT@ECT  John,Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your offer.Regards,Garyx31511John Arnold10/08/2000 02:05 PM  I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week.   				  John(s),How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to argue for one or the other.Regards,Garyx31511",corporate,No

2398,1495,"The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore count as a total of four deals.     We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.Pete Berzinsx57597",corporate,No

Both the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest sound amazing, but I think I'd lean towards the coastal hike. There's just something magical about the ocean breeze and the rugged coastline that I find incredibly refreshing.As for your gastroenterologist appointment, try not to worry too much. The doctor will likely start with a thorough medical history and physical exam, and then discuss any necessary tests or procedures. Remember, they're there to help you, so don't hesitate to ask questions or voice any concerns you may have. If you'd like, I can recommend a fantastic gastroenterologist in your area who I think you'd really like.On another note, I've been giving a lot of thought to that job offer I mentioned. It's a fantastic opportunity, but the thought of leaving my current practice and moving away from friends and family is really weighing on me.

2424,1981,"<email>Hi Michael,I hope you're doing well. I wanted to thank you again for your fantastic collaboration during the professional development workshop. The feedback we received from our colleagues was overwhelmingly positive, and I believe our presentation made a significant impact.Several teachers approached us after the workshop, expressing their interest in implementing some of our strategies in their classrooms. I think this is a testament to the effectiveness of our collaborative approach.I'd love to continue working with you on more projects and share our knowledge with other teachers in the school. Perhaps we can organize a series of workshops or create a resource bank for our colleagues to access.Let me know your thoughts, and let's schedule a meeting to discuss our next steps.Best regards,Sarah",research,No

2427,1579,"Thanks.Andy Zipper@ENRON07/19/2000 08:27 AM  By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.any questions please feel free to call.-andy",corporate,No

2430,702,"Ned,Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

Enhancedtrading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesalecustomer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company'soff-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributedto the record second-quarter performance.The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBITto $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higherrealized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following thereorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices forthe quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, fromthe year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per dayand oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was dueprimarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together withthe acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillionBtu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural GasTransmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million comparedwith an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of costsavings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlementfiled in March.The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 millioncompared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects inBrazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company'sinvestment in the Philippines.Telecom Update``We have made substantial progress in the development of ourtelecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,we have named Greg G.

I've always admired your expertise in low-level network programming and your ability to optimize system performance. It's no wonder they've kept you around!As for my startup idea, I've been developing a novel network protocol that aims to improve the efficiency and security of data transmission in distributed systems. I believe it could have applications in various industries, from cloud computing to IoT devices.I'd love to share more details and get your input. How about we schedule a video call for next Tuesday at 3 PM? That way, we can discuss it in real-time and maybe even do a quick screen share if needed.Let me know if that works for you, and feel free to bring any ideas you've been working on as well.

2438,34,"George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment  What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?  By whom? What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction  When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names?These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.

2441,1478,"Re: trucking LNG to California - The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and subsequent loading onto trucks.Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely transfer it into storage. The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some reason. I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. Please let me know if you have specific questions.",corporate,No

2463,2734,"<email>Hey Michael,I hope you're having a great week so far! I wanted to run a new project idea by you that I think could be really engaging for our students. I was thinking about how we could combine vocabulary development with physics concepts, and I came up with an idea for a project called ""The Physics of Language.""The basic premise is that students would choose a physics concept (like gravity, friction, or momentum) and then write a short story or poem that incorporates vocabulary words related to that concept. The story or poem would need to demonstrate an understanding of the physics concept and use the vocabulary words in a meaningful way.I think this project could help our students see the connections between language and science, and it would give them a chance to be creative while also learning important concepts in both subjects. What do you think? Would you be interested in collaborating on this project with me?Let me know your thoughts!Best,Emily",research,No

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.

I would be more than happy to assist you in developing your lesson plan on the intersection of women's rights and politics in the 20th century.Some key figures and events that I believe are essential to include are:1. The women's suffrage movement and the passage of the 19th Amendment in 19202. The role of women in the workforce during World War II and the subsequent push for equal pay3. The Civil Rights Movement and the intersection of gender and race in the struggle for equality4. The women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 70s, including the fight for reproductive rights and the Equal Rights Amendment5. The impact of Title IX on women's education and athleticsAs for resources, I highly recommend the following books:- ""The Woman Suffrage Movement in America"" by Corrine M. McConnaughy- ""The Feminine Mystique"" by Betty Friedan- ""Sisterhood is Powerful"" edited by Robin Morgan- ""The Second Sex"" by Simone de BeauvoirI would be happy to discuss these topics further and provide additional resources if needed.

2481,2433,"<email>Hi Sarah,Thanks for your email! I'm glad to hear you're excited about the project and the upcoming conference. I completely understand your concerns about simplifying the genetic concepts for our target audience. It's a challenge, but I'm confident we can find a way to make it accessible and engaging.I think the key is to focus on the big picture and the real-world applications of these concepts. For example, instead of delving into the technical details of DNA sequencing, we could start with a basic explanation of what DNA is and why it's important. Then, we could discuss how sequencing DNA can help us understand genetic diseases and develop new treatments.Here are a few resources that might help:1. ""DNA 101"" video series by the National Human Genome Research Institute: https://www.genome.gov/video/dna-101-video-series2. ""Your Genes, Your Health"" interactive website: http://www.ygyh.org/3.

2488,2919,"<email>Emily,It's great to hear from you, although I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so stressed about the exhibit. I completely understand what you're going through. When I was in the final stages of writing my book, I felt like I was constantly on edge, questioning every word and worrying about meeting my deadline.The most important thing, I think, is to remember to take care of yourself. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks when you need them. It's easy to let work consume you, but you'll be more productive and creative if you give yourself time to recharge.It's also helpful to lean on your support system during times like these. Talk to your family and friends about what you're going through, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. And remember, even though it feels like the world is ending if this exhibit isn't perfect, there will be other opportunities and other exhibits. This is just one moment in your career.I'm excited to hear about your potential trip to Mongolia! That sounds like an incredible opportunity, and I'm sure you'll discover some amazing fossils. I know it can be daunting to plan a trip like that, but I bet once you're out there, you'll be so caught up in the excitement of the research that you won't even think about the challenges.As for our summer plans, yes, we are still hoping to get to the beach. We're thinking about renting a house on the Outer Banks for a week in July. I'm looking forward to some quality family time and a chance to relax after the intensity of the past year.I'd love to get together soon to catch up in person. How about lunch next week? I can come to your neck of the woods, and we can talk more about your exhibit and your trip.Hang in there, Emily. You're doing amazing work, and I know the exhibit will be a huge success. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.Best,Robert",research,No
2489,2135,"the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different.    where's your curve now?MAyJuneJulAugSepOctNovDec Jan 02Jen FraserEnron Global Markets Fundamentals713-853-4759",research,No

2494,2169,"<email>Hi Michael,I've been looking over the latest draft of our paper, and I think we're making great progress. However, I have a few concerns about the section on the economic factors leading up to the war. I feel like we're not giving enough weight to the role of the cotton industry in the South. What are your thoughts on this? I think we should discuss this further before we submit the paper.Best,Emily",research,No
2495,1638,"Jacques,Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  The key business points are:1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some tweaking.  Phillip Allen713-853-7041pallen@enron.com",corporate,Yes

2497,1130,"Thanks.Andy Zipper@ENRON07/19/2000 08:27 AM  By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.any questions please feel free to call.-andy",corporate,No

2499,860,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.",corporate,No
