Dec. 20, 2001

Argentina's president resigned, a high-ranking official said. The end of De
la Rua's two-year term, amid violent reaction to his handling of a deepening
financial crisis, came hours after the country's economy minister stepped
down.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer 
biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among 
the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see 
straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now 
i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this 
level though.  ",corporate,No

Attached is the file I'm proposing to send to Chase with suggested wording.  To eliminate ""Chase""  from using data to ""back-in"" to pnl, we deleted all up days, and forwarded out corrected data, per files received from Jeff and Stacey.

Please review and provide feedback.  Additionally, if you are comfortable with data, please authorize its release.

Thanks
Frank


 


""Steve

Following on from our discussion concerning the back testing data, we have re-checked the underlying data with our middle office. There were some errors in your file which we have now corrected, and for clarity, included losses in the backtest file, since these are what we consider in the backtest process. 

I trust this helps - let us know if you need anything further

Subject: RE: Collaboration on an article about paper and folding

Hi Hiro,

Thank you so much for agreeing to collaborate on this article. I'm thrilled to have your expertise on board!

I've attached a draft of my initial research on the linguistic roots of words related to paper and folding. As you'll see, I've focused primarily on Old English and Proto-Germanic terms, but I believe that incorporating the history and techniques of origami could help shed light on how these words have evolved over time.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or additional resources that could help strengthen the article. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the specific terms used in origami and how they've influenced the English language.

I'm available to discuss our ideas further next week, if that works for you. Please let me know what day and time would be convenient for you.

Thank you again for your willingness to collaborate on this project. I'm excited to see where our combined knowledge will take us!

Best regards,

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Dear Emily,

I wanted to thank you for the wonderful presentation on vaccinations during pregnancy at the community center last week. As a homeschooling parent, I'm always looking for reliable information to help me make the best decisions for my family's health.

I'm currently pregnant with my second child and have a 4-year-old daughter. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to manage the new baby's vaccination schedule while ensuring my daughter's health and homeschooling routine are not disrupted. I would greatly appreciate any insights you could share.

Thank you for your time and expertise.

Hey David,

It's been a while since we last talked! I hope you're doing well and enjoying your work at SoftDev Solutions. I'm reaching out because I'm working on an exciting project at FoodScience Innovations, and I think you might be the perfect person to help me with it.

We're developing a new food product that's both healthy and delicious, and I need help creating a software application to track the chemical composition of the ingredients and the final product. Your expertise in designing and implementing service-oriented applications using Microsoft technologies would be invaluable to this project.

Would you be interested in meeting up for coffee sometime to discuss this further? I'd love to catch up and see if we can collaborate on this project.

Let me know your thoughts!

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

        per share before the impact of certain non-recurring charges.
Second
        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
        pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results
        exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or
        $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
        pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
        issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
        2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
        Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
        related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale

        resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19
million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. As you might know, I'm planning a research trip to Asia to study Homo erectus fossils and collaborate with colleagues from various institutions. Since English is not the first language for many of my colleagues, I was wondering if you could provide me with some tips on how to effectively communicate with them. Any advice on language learning resources or strategies would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your prompt response. I am happy to confirm that I can meet on Tuesday, March 15th, at 10:00 AM at the university campus. I look forward to discussing the project in more detail and meeting the students who will be working with me.

I have been doing some more research on acid rain and its effects on plant growth since we last communicated, and I am excited to share my findings with you and your students. I believe that this project will not only help me improve my Swedish language skills but also deepen my understanding of the environmental issues we are facing.

Please let me know if there is anything I should prepare or bring to the meeting. I am eager to get started on this collaboration and contribute to the success of the project.

Hello Sarah,

It's great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about this topic. The Bermuda Triangle has always been a fascinating subject, and I've come across some interesting historical accounts that might be relevant to your article.

I recently stumbled upon a lesser-known maritime mystery involving the disappearance of a ship in the early 19th century. The circumstances surrounding the incident are quite puzzling and could make for an interesting case study. I'd be happy to share more details if you're interested.

Additionally, I think a collaboration between our fields could yield some exciting results. Perhaps we could work together to investigate some of these unexplained phenomena using a combination of historical research and scientific analysis.

Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss this further.

Subject: Reuters Story on E-Exchange


By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business.""
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
""giant matrix"" within the system.
   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.
   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer.""
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business"".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

Dear Jordan,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you today because I urgently need your expertise in constitutional law and judicial process. I am currently working on a high-profile case involving the legal implications of a radiological disaster response, and I believe that your insights would be invaluable in ensuring that our efforts are legally sound and effective.

As you may know, there is an upcoming court hearing that will determine the fate of our response efforts. We are facing significant pressure from a powerful government agency to achieve a specific outcome, and I am concerned that this may compromise our ability to uphold the rule of law and protect the public interest.

I would be grateful if you could provide your expert opinion on the legal and constitutional issues at play in this case, as well as your recommendations for how we should proceed. I understand that this is a highly sensitive matter, and I assure you that your input will be treated with the utmost confidentiality.

Please let me know if you are available to discuss this further. I am happy to provide you with any additional information or documentation that you may need.

Hey Jordan,

Thanks for your insightful response. I completely agree with you on the significance of Cassini's findings, especially regarding Enceladus and Titan. It's incredible to think that these distant moons could potentially harbor life.

As for my project, it's coming along quite well. I've been analyzing the data from Cassini's rings observations and trying to create a comprehensive model of their composition and structure. It's challenging work, but I'm excited about the potential discoveries that could come out of it.

Speaking of which, I recently came across an article about the upcoming total solar eclipse that will be visible in our region. I was thinking of making a trip to see it and was wondering if you'd be interested in joining me. It could be a great opportunity to witness a celestial event together and bond over our shared passion for astronomy.

Dear Dr. Sokolov,

I hope this email finds you well. I enjoyed our conversation at the Interdisciplinary Conference last month and found your presentation on resource management in socialist countries fascinating. I've been thinking about the potential for a collaborative project exploring the historical lessons that can be applied to sustainable space exploration and settlement.

I believe that your expertise in the history of communism and socialism could provide valuable insights into how different ideological frameworks have shaped resource management and environmental policies in the past. By understanding these historical contexts, we may be able to develop more sustainable and equitable approaches to space exploration and settlement.

I would love to discuss this idea further with you. Would you be available for a virtual meeting in the coming weeks to explore potential avenues for collaboration?

Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not

Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus 
opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's


	

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

I love your ideas for incorporating multimedia elements and interactive maps into the website. Those additions would definitely make the content more engaging and accessible to a wider audience.

Also, I wanted to mention that I've been thinking about the potential impact our website could have beyond just our city. I wonder if there might be opportunities to partner with other organizations and expand the scope of our project. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this as well.

Subject: RE: Excited to collaborate!

Hi Emily,

I'm so glad you reached out! I've been thinking about our conversations as well and I'm really intrigued by the idea of exploring the connections between our fields. I think a collaboration could be really productive and lead to some exciting new insights.

I've been reading your paper on the history of the discovery of DNA and I'm struck by the way scientific discoveries can reshape our understanding of the world in much the same way that linguistic developments can. There seem to be some really interesting parallels there.

I would definitely be interested in working together on this project. I think we could start by outlining our main arguments and gathering evidence to support them. Perhaps we could each take the lead on a different section of the paper based on our respective areas of expertise.

I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic with you and see where it leads. Let me know what you think about the next steps.

Best,
Ahmed",research,No

Subject: Request for information on pump technology in World War II

Dear Mr. Thompson,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Emily Johnson, and I am a high school social studies teacher at Ridgemont High School. A mutual acquaintance of ours, Sarah Nguyen, suggested that I reach out to you regarding a lesson plan I am developing on the role of technology in World War II.

I am particularly interested in learning more about the advancements in pump technology during this period and how they contributed to the war effort. I believe that including this information in my curriculum would provide my students with a unique perspective on the impact of the war on engineering and technological progress.

Would you be willing to share some insights on this topic? I would greatly appreciate any information you could provide, such as specific examples of pump technologies used during the war, their applications, and the impact of these advancements on modern engineering practices.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I would be grateful for any time you can spare to assist me in this endeavor.

Best regards,
Emily Johnson",research,No

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay 
something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and 
a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock 
will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put 
up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the 
negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the 
utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Phillip Allen

Renee,

Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.

Thank you,

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on ""Comments"" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on ""comments"" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on ""send"" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.  so 
many technicians bullshit  their way ""support at 5400-5600 but if it breaks 
that look for 5250"".  if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with 
entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of people would be

Hi Emily,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been great keeping in touch since we met at the Indigenous education conference last year. I've been thinking a lot about our conversations and the work you're doing in anthropology, particularly around Indigenous education and cultural preservation.

I've been considering a career change and am interested in pursuing a path similar to yours. I'm passionate about adapting education to fit the unique needs of Indigenous students, and I believe that understanding the historical and cultural context is crucial to this work.

Would you be open to chatting further about your career journey and any advice you might have for someone like me who's considering a transition into anthropology? I'd love to learn from your experience and insights.

Best regards,

theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives 
cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell 
gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so 
much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets 
priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence 
the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he 
talks about it

agreewith all, im mega bear summer 2nd q but for the time being weather and
as u
said uncertainy likely to lend itself so little downside until either
weather
gets warm or injections get big. i dont see the flow as you know but i talk
to a
cupla utitlities and the bias same as you menioned. ive neutralized bear
book a
bit cuz i cant afford to fite this thing. with deep pockets tho-i scale up
sell
next 2-3 weeks take a bet on 200 ish injections in april and 400 in may-ie
records
  aug/oct-yes-low risk-wasnt substantially more inverted when we were 4
bucks
higher-low risk but not a great reward. oct/nov-yea-wont make much for
another
few months on that so it range trades but ill cont to bersd it cuz if end
summer
that strong im always always more bullish the front of winter.
  other thing i wonder is how wide these summer contangos cud get-as
everyone so
bullish futs for the next few weeks at least.
   weather here sucks to day-tree almost fell on me driving into work-close

Hey Michael,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because I noticed that we're both attending the Chemistry Education Conference in San Francisco next month. I'm really looking forward to learning about the latest teaching strategies and techniques to help our students better understand chemistry concepts.

I was wondering if you'd like to meet up for dinner one evening during the conference to discuss what we've learned and share our thoughts on how we can implement these ideas in our classrooms. I know we often collaborate on lesson plans, so I thought it might be a great opportunity to brainstorm together.

Let me know if you're interested, and if so, which day works best for you. I'm free any evening except for the last day of the conference.

Looking forward to seeing you in San Francisco!

Hi Jenna,

Good to hear from you! I'm excited for the event and I think we've put together a really solid program. A few thoughts:

- The schedule looks perfect. The break in between should give us time to reset the stage and make sure everything's ready for the veteran portion.

- I took a look at the remarks and they're great! You've really captured the spirit of what we're trying to do. I made a few minor tweaks and added a line about the legacy of the Russian Empire's involvement in WWI, but otherwise it's excellent.

- I have the final RSVP list and will send it over today. I think we'll be at capacity, so we may need to add some extra chairs!

As for meeting up, I'm free Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday evening if that works for you. Let me know what time is best and I'll make the coffee! 

I really appreciate all the hard work you've put into this, Jenna. It's been a pleasure working with you and I know the attendees will be in for a treat.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

David,

Our meeting yesterday was incredibly productive. I'm excited about the examples we discussed and the direction we're heading with the textbook.

I heard back from the publisher, and they're on board with our approach. They even offered to put us in touch with their legal team to ensure we're on solid ground with our examples.

I think we have a strong case for the grant, and I'm confident that our innovative methods will impress the committee.

Let's keep pushing forward with our writing and stay in close communication as we finalize our grant application.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.

Mark,

Thank you so much for your prompt response. I really appreciate your willingness to help. Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. I'll send you a calendar invite with the meeting details.

In the meantime, I do have a couple of questions:
1. What are the key satellite products you recommend for severe weather forecasting?
2. How do you typically integrate satellite data with radar data in your forecasts?

I'd be grateful if you could give me a brief overview before our call, so I can come prepared with more specific questions.

Thank you again for your support. It means a lot, especially given my current circumstances.

Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Subject: RE: Grant Application - Game-based Learning Tool for Children with Hearing Impairments

Hi Michael,

I love the idea of incorporating a reward system and adaptive difficulty levels into the game! That would definitely help keep children motivated and engaged. We could also consider adding some sort of social element, where children can connect with other players who have similar hearing impairments and share their progress and experiences.

I've made some revisions to the project proposal based on our discussion and attached the updated version. Please take a look and let me know if you have any further suggestions.

I'm excited about the progress we've made so far and can't wait to bring this project to life!

Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to you because I'm currently working on a project that I think you might be able to help with. I'm researching the impact of European settlement on Indigenous Australian cultures, specifically focusing on the early colonial period. Given your extensive knowledge on maritime exploration and early Australian settlement, I was hoping you might be able to provide some insights or point me towards any relevant resources you've come across in your research.

I'm particularly interested in understanding the initial interactions between the First Fleet settlers and the Indigenous communities they encountered. Any information you could share would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Subject: RE: Guest Lecture on Astronomy and Geography

Dear Emily,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting opportunity! I am thrilled to have a solar physics researcher interested in giving a guest lecture at our school. Your insights on the relationship between astronomy and geography would be a valuable addition to our curriculum.

I would be happy to discuss potential topics for your lecture and how we can integrate it into our geography lessons. Understanding the Earth's place in the universe is indeed crucial for our students' comprehension of the world around them.

As for the textbooks, I recommend ""Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation"" by Tom L. McKnight and Darrel Hess, and ""Essentials of Geography"" by Arthur Getis and Judith Getis. These books provide a comprehensive introduction to the field and cover a wide range of topics, from landforms and climate to human-environment interactions.

I am also intrigued by your interest in the history of scientific discoveries and how they have shaped our understanding of the world. This is a topic that I am passionate about, and I believe our students would greatly benefit from learning about the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines.

Perhaps we could explore the possibility of collaborating on a project to create educational materials that bridge the gap between astronomy and geography. I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea.

Looking forward to our further discussions!

We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

I hope you're doing well! I noticed you've been struggling with the latest problem set on special relativity. If you'd like, we can go over the concepts together during my office hours this Friday. I'll be available from 3-5 pm in the physics building, room 212.

Also, I wanted to mention that I've been impressed with your enthusiasm and dedication to learning. If you're considering a career in physics, I'd be happy to provide some guidance and answer any questions you might have about college applications and potential career paths.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Phillip

Hi Raj,

It was great meeting you at the Electrical Measurement and Instrumentation Conference last month. I really enjoyed our conversation about the latest trends in electrical measurement tools and how they can be applied in educational settings.

I was wondering if you might be available for a quick call sometime next week to discuss a troubleshooting problem I've been having with one of the circuits in my lab. It's a bit outside my area of expertise, and I thought you might have some insights to offer.

Let me know if you have any availability, and I'd be happy to schedule a call.

Hi Emily,

Thank you for the update. I'm thrilled to hear that our project has been recognized and that we have the opportunity to present at the education conference. I would be more than happy to collaborate with you on the presentation.

I think it's a great idea to share our experiences and discuss the challenges we faced. It would also be valuable to include data and testimonials from students and parents to support our claims about the benefits of outdoor learning.

Let's schedule a meeting to brainstorm ideas for the presentation and to divide the tasks. I'm available next week on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

Looking forward to working with you on this exciting project!

Subject: Upcoming Conference Panel

Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we have been invited to participate in a panel discussion at the upcoming history conference in Chicago. The topic of our presentation is the economic and social factors leading to the American Civil War.

I think it's a great opportunity for us to collaborate and share our expertise on this important subject. I was wondering if you have any initial thoughts on how we should structure our presentation and what key points we should cover.

I believe that combining our research on the 18th and 19th centuries will provide a comprehensive overview of the issues at hand. Perhaps we can start by outlining the main economic and social differences between the North and the South, and then discuss how these factors contributed to the growing tensions that ultimately led to the war.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you have any specific ideas or suggestions for our presentation. I look forward to working with you on this exciting project.

Subject: Collaborative project update

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking a lot about our project and the upcoming conference. I'm excited to share our work with the education community, but I'm also feeling a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of some of the genetic concepts we're trying to include.

I was wondering if you could help me break down some of these ideas into more digestible pieces. I think it would be really valuable for our target audience (high school students) to have a solid understanding of the basic principles behind DNA sequencing and genetic analysis, but I'm not sure how to simplify it without losing the essential details.

Do you have any suggestions or resources that might help me grasp these concepts better? I'd really appreciate your input.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,

Subject: Forward-forward Vol

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Vlady.

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Faith,

Two changes need to be made to the list.  First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk.  Second,  Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G.  I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC.  Please let me know.

Subject: RE: Historical Solar Observations and Our Paper

Olivia,

That's a great idea! I'd be happy to contribute a section on modern solar observation techniques. In fact, I recently came across some intriguing data from the 1980s while going through the archives here at Mauna Loa. It's about a particularly strong solar flare and its impact on Earth's ionosphere. I think it could be a perfect case study for our paper.

I'm attaching the data I found. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss how to incorporate it into the paper.

Also, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference in San Diego! We should definitely arrange a time to meet up and go over our paper in person.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the 
closing statement or on some other document.

Jordan,

That's a tough situation with the job offer from the private forecasting company. I completely understand your hesitation to leave the national weather service and our collaboration. It's a decision that could have a significant impact on both our professional and personal lives.

I think applying for a grant from the National Science Foundation is a great idea. If we can secure funding, it would allow us to continue our research here and maintain our close working relationship. I'm more than happy to help in any way I can with the application process.

I'm definitely free to grab a coffee and discuss this further. How about we meet at our usual spot, The Weathered Cup, this Friday afternoon? We can brainstorm strategies and start putting together a plan for our grant application.

Looking forward to seeing you then!

I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer 
buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.

Hi Ethan,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm glad you found my posts helpful. Digitizing a stamp collection is a great way to preserve and share your passion for philately. I recommend using a high-resolution scanner with a transparency adapter for scanning your stamps. As for organizing your digital collection, I suggest using a database software like MySQL or a content management system like WordPress with a custom plugin for collections.

I'd be happy to provide more detailed guidance if you need it. By the way, I'm always on the lookout for interesting stories related to technology and communication. If you have any anecdotes about your stamps or the history of postal services, I'd love to hear them!

Subject: Seeking your expertise on a rare find

Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. It's been a while since our last collaboration, and I've been meaning to catch up with you. I'm reaching out today because I could use your invaluable expertise on a new acquisition for our museum.

We recently obtained a fascinating Buddhist artifact that has left our team puzzled. It's a intricately carved wooden statue of the Buddha, but with some unusual iconography that we've never encountered before. I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on its origins and significance.

Would you be available for a call next week to discuss this further? I'd be happy to send you some images of the artifact beforehand.

Looking forward to hearing from you and hopefully working together again.

Hi Emily,

Thank you so much for your email and for sharing your lesson plans! I'm excited to take a closer look and incorporate some of your techniques into my own teaching.

I've been thinking a lot about our conversation and the challenges of providing quality art education to students from low-income backgrounds. It's something I'm really passionate about, and I believe that collaborating with other teachers is key to making a bigger impact.

I had an idea I wanted to run by you - what if we organized a virtual art show featuring students from both of our schools? We could have them create pieces inspired by the same theme or art movement and then display their work together online. Maybe we could even arrange some virtual meet-and-greets so the students can interact with each other.

Let me know what you think! I'd love to brainstorm further and potentially apply for a grant to help fund the project.

Subject: RE: Collaborating on a project

Hey Emily,

Wednesday at 4 PM works great for me. I'll add it to my calendar.

I like your idea of breaking the guide down into modules with interactive activities and quizzes. That should help keep students engaged and make the learning process more enjoyable. We can also consider including some hands-on projects that allow students to apply what they've learned.

I've been thinking about the technical aspects we should cover, and I've come up with a rough outline:

1. Introduction to computer hardware
2. CPU and processor basics
3. Memory (RAM and storage)
4. Motherboards and expansion cards
5. Power supply and cooling
6. Peripherals and input/output devices

We can definitely refine this further during our call and decide on the best way to present the information.

I'm also curious to know if you have any specific vocabulary-related activities in mind for each module. I think your expertise will be crucial in making the technical concepts more accessible.

Looking forward to our call next week!

Hey Jordan,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base with you about the progress we've made on the climate change and geological events mapping project. We've managed to gather a significant amount of data on potential landslide and volcanic activity hotspots, and I think we're ready to start creating some preliminary maps.

I was wondering if you could take a look at the data we've collected and let me know if there are any historical mapping techniques that might be useful for visualizing this information. I'm particularly interested in any methods that could help us convey the potential impact of these events on human settlements in a clear and accessible way.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions. I'm excited to see what we can create together!

Subject: RE: Help with electron configuration in molecular orbital theory

Hi Emily,

Thank you for bringing this up. I've definitely noticed the same issue in my classes, and I agree that we need to find a better way to explain electron configuration in the context of molecular orbital theory.

I've been doing some research, and I came across a few resources that might be helpful. There's a great video series by Professor XYZ from ABC University that breaks down electron configuration in a really clear and engaging way. I think we could use some of his explanations and visualizations in our simulations.

I also found a few interactive tools that allow students to manipulate electron configurations and see how they affect molecular orbitals in real-time. I think incorporating something like that into our project could be really beneficial for students' understanding.

What do you think? If you're interested, I can send you the links to the resources I found, and we can discuss how we might integrate them into our simulations.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

done on the ICE system yesterday evening:

  -Deleted WTI monthly time spreads
  -Deleted WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with
legging)
  -Deleted 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with
legging)

  -Added WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with NO
legging)
  -Added 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with NO
legging)

 Unfortunately the WTI/Brent and the 1% NYH Fuel Oil Crack contracts
(with the legging functionality) have been removed from your portfolios. You
will need to add  the first four nearby months' contracts to your
portfolios by going to Admin / Manage Portfolios / Edit your portfolio....

Maria,

This is truly remarkable! The photographs you've sent are fascinating, and I can already see the potential implications for our research. I agree that we must find a way to include this new information in our paper.

I have a few initial thoughts on how we might proceed:

1. We should prioritize the analysis of the new site and its features, focusing on how it compares to known pre-Columbian and medieval European fishing structures.

2. We may need to restructure some sections of our paper to accommodate this new information, particularly the introduction and conclusion.

3. I will reach out to the journal editor today to request a two-week extension, citing the significance of this new discovery. Hopefully, they will be understanding.

4. We should schedule a video call this week to discuss our revised strategy and divide tasks to ensure we meet the new deadline.

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions or concerns. I'm excited to work together on this groundbreaking research!

Due to some problems with my email yesterday, I may not have received your 
RSVP.....please excuse any confusion this may have caused.


RSVP REQUESTED!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an ""Emissions Strategy 
Meeting"" on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air 
quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and 
explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial 
groups.

to call in.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your

Hi Jake,

Friday at 2 PM works perfectly for me! I'll keep an eye out for the Zoom link.

I've started looking through the articles you sent, and they're fascinating. I especially like the one about connecting math and art through geometric patterns. I've been thinking about how I could use that idea to create a lesson on tessellations and symmetry.

I'm attaching a rough outline of the lesson plan I've been working on. I'd love your feedback, especially on how I could incorporate some of the media strategies we discussed.

Looking forward to our chat on Friday!

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Alex,

I couldn't agree more! I think exploring the intersection of literature and science could lead to a richer understanding of the natural world and its significance. In fact, I have an idea: what if we collaborate on a project that investigates the representation of nature and ecology in both our fields? We could aim to publish an interdisciplinary paper or create an educational resource that showcases the power of symbolism in connecting literature and science.

If you're interested, we could start by outlining the scope and objectives of the project, and then divide the tasks based on our expertise. I'm excited to see where this collaboration could lead!

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  
  

WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years 
Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003 
Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas 
Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company 

LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Devon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debt  
General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines 
Pioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas 
Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure 
   
*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. 

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.

Subject: RE: Upcoming visit to Costa Rica

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the invitation! I'm excited to have the opportunity to visit the excavation site and see the fish weir in person. It's a fantastic chance to gather more information for our paper and discuss our findings.

I'll be able to make it from June 1st onwards. Please send me the travel and accommodation details whenever it's convenient for you.

Looking forward to our collaboration and the exciting discoveries that await us in Costa Rica!

Best,

I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,
John

Thanks for the inquiry.  I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up.  
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here.  He is very valuable to me and ENA.  Please let me 
know.

Reagan,

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Hey Samira,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out and share some exciting news with you. I recently acquired a new telescope, and I've been blown away by the clarity and detail of the observations I've been able to make. I can't wait to share my findings with you and get your insights on the best techniques for observing some of the celestial objects I've been focusing on.

Also, I wanted to mention that I'm planning to attend the upcoming astronomy conference in Denver next month. I know you mentioned you were thinking about going, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in meeting up while we're there. It would be great to catch up in person and maybe even do some stargazing together if we get the chance.

Let me know if you're planning to attend and if you'd like to coordinate our schedules. I'm really looking forward to the conference and the opportunity to learn from some of the top minds in our field.

I'm sorry to hear that you've been having some health issues. As someone who deals with vascular issues on a regular basis, I'd be more than happy to take a look and see if there's anything that might be causing your symptoms. It could be something simple that's easily treatable, or it could be something more serious that needs attention. Either way, I'm here to help in any way I can.

Why don't you come by my office next week and we can discuss it further? I'll make sure to block off some time so we can talk in detail.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent 
historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right 
now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to 
prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your 
markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is

Subject: RE: Literacy Event Planning

Hi Emily,

Thanks for your email! I love the ideas you've suggested for the literacy event. The student-led dramatic reading and the ""readers' theater"" performance are sure to be hits with the students and their families. I also like the idea of having a creative writing station and a bookmark-making station to engage the attendees in hands-on activities.

Your suggestion to divide the responsibilities is great! I'm happy to take charge of the creative writing and bookmark-making stations. I think it's a good balance of our strengths and interests.

I have a few more ideas to add to the mix:

1. A ""book swap"" where students can bring gently used books to trade with their peers
2. A ""story walk"" where pages of a book are displayed around the school grounds, and families can take a stroll while reading the story together
3. A ""costume corner"" where students can dress up as their favorite book characters

Let me know what you think of these ideas, and we can finalize the plans soon.

I'm excited to collaborate with you on this event and showcase the amazing work our students have been doing in our language arts program!

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Subject: RE: Exciting new results on Io's volcanism

Emily,

This is fantastic work! I've looked over your draft and the data you've provided, and I'm equally excited about the implications. I agree that the correlation between the distribution of volcanic centers and Io's tidal deformation is too strong to ignore.

I've started cross-referencing the Juno data with the Galileo data, and the pattern holds up. In fact, I think I've found some additional evidence that supports your findings.

I've attached a document with my preliminary analysis and some suggestions for strengthening the paper. I think we should also consider discussing the potential implications for other tidally heated moons, like Europa and Enceladus.

I'm happy to take the lead on revising the paper based on your draft and my analysis. Shall we aim to submit this to Nature Geoscience? I think it's a good fit for our findings.

Let's schedule a call for early next week to finalize our strategy and divide up the remaining tasks.

Great work, Emily! I'm thrilled about this breakthrough and the potential impact it could have on our field.

Hi Jamie,

I'm so glad you like the lesson plan templates! I think they provide a good starting point, but you're right, we'll need to expand on them to create a more comprehensive guide. I'm happy to take a look at what you come up with and provide feedback.

I'm also excited to see the PowerPoint slides when they're ready. I'll be sure to review them thoroughly and provide any suggestions for improvement.

Overall, I'm feeling really good about this project. I think we've created a framework that is both theoretically sound and practical in its application. I can't wait to share it with our colleagues at the conference!

Let's touch base again early next week to discuss our progress and make sure we're on track for the conference deadline.

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Hi David,

I absolutely love the idea of incorporating growth mindset into our workshop! It's such an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to helping students overcome challenges and develop a love for learning. I think that's a perfect addition to our proposal.

Next Tuesday after school works great for me to meet. Let's plan on meeting in my classroom around 3:30pm? That will give us some time to brainstorm and start putting together an outline before the end of the day.

I'm attaching a few resources that I think could be helpful as we put together our proposal. I've found them really valuable in my own teaching, and I think they could provide some great insights for our workshop.

I'm so excited to dive into this project with you, David. I have no doubt that this is going to be an amazing workshop that will make a real difference for educators and students alike.

See you next Tuesday!

Subject: Exciting manuscript discovery!

Dear Robert,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some exciting news with you. While doing research at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, I stumbled upon a previously unknown manuscript containing Old English texts that could shed new light on the language's evolution.

The manuscript appears to be from the late 10th century and includes a variety of texts, some of which seem to be previously unrecorded. I've been working on deciphering and translating the texts, but I could really use your expertise and insights.

Would you be interested in collaborating on this project? I think our combined knowledge of Old English and Proto-Germanic languages could help us unlock the secrets of this manuscript.

Let me know your thoughts!

Subject: RE: Collaborating on a multicultural art project

Emily,

I'm excited to dive into this project with you and your students! Your idea of creating a series of lesson plans focusing on specific communities is fantastic. I would be more than happy to provide resources and insights for each community we feature. I have a wealth of information from my research and travels that I believe would be valuable for your students.

I'm currently working on a research paper about the cultural significance of certain traditional foods and their impact on community health. I think this could be a great starting point for our project. We could focus on a few communities featured in my paper and explore their unique culinary traditions and health practices.

As for our shared passion for traveling, I would love to share some of my experiences with you. I've had the opportunity to visit several countries and immerse myself in different cultures, which has greatly influenced my work and perspective on global health. I'm sure you have some fascinating stories to share as well!

I'll start compiling resources for our first few lessons and send them your way soon. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any specific communities or themes in mind that you'd like to explore.

1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some 
will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation 
i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back 
as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people 
think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes 
out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away 
to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a 
$2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward 
curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will 
end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the 
ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that 
prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact 
that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

Subject: Understanding the natural view


1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?

million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel 
Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude 
oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value 
to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is 
currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental 
Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather 
derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services 
is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.

Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance 
regarding these sell side opportunities.

Jay,

I need to compile a report that shows transaction volume by basis location(Basis Swaps) and volume by location for Phys Forwards as well as Finc Swaps for Power.

We have given them a list of the locations at which we like to make markets.  They want to see historical volumes at those location to judge the liquidity at each location.  

You can reach me at 713-515-3949 or x37041. 

Thanks for your help.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the

likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in

Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Subject: Re: Request for expertise

Dear Julian,

Thank you so much for agreeing to help with the dictionary project. I'm excited to collaborate with you and learn from your expertise.

I've attached a list of the physics terms I'm currently working on. Any insights you can provide on their meanings and implications would be incredibly helpful.

Regarding your upcoming lecture, I have a few suggestions that might help make your ideas more accessible to a general audience:

1. Use analogies and metaphors to relate complex concepts to everyday experiences. For example, you could compare the expansion of the universe to the stretching of a rubber band or the growth of a balloon.

2. Employ visual aids like diagrams, animations, or demonstrations to illustrate your points. Visual representations can help bridge the gap between abstract ideas and concrete understanding.

3. Break down your lecture into smaller, manageable chunks and provide clear transitions between each section. This will help your audience follow your train of thought and retain the information more easily.

4. Encourage questions and engagement from the audience. Allowing time for discussion and clarification can help ensure that your message is being understood and can also provide valuable feedback for future presentations.

I'd be happy to discuss these suggestions further or provide additional guidance as you prepare your lecture.

On a personal note, I couldn't help but notice that you mentioned attending Weston College in your bio. I have a good friend, Ethan Chen, who studied physics there around the same time. Do you happen to know him?

Thank you again for your willingness to collaborate on this project. I look forward to working with you and learning from your expertise.

Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Gentlemen

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Subject:	Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

Subject: RE: Considering a career change

Hi Alex,

It's great to hear from you! I'm always happy to discuss my work and share my insights with friends, especially when it comes to finding ways to make our industries more sustainable.

I think your background in geothermal energy could definitely be valuable in the pharmaceutical world. Clinical trials often require a lot of energy to power the equipment and facilities, so finding ways to reduce our carbon footprint is a top priority for many companies.

I'm actually working on a new project right now that involves developing more efficient and environmentally friendly practices for our clinical trials. I would love to have your input and expertise on the matter.

Would you be available for a video call next week to discuss this further? I'm free on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning, if either of those times work for you.

Jim,

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  

Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Phillip

Phillip,

Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!
We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our
'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!

Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.
Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease
originally. The other two are new.

The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10
years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus
kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income
after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash
on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.

We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know
if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will
last long. With best regards, Jim Wills

Alex,

I love your ideas for the interactive activities during the event! A mini eco-workshop and guided tour of the historic features would be a fantastic way to engage the community and showcase the educational aspects of the center.

Thank you for taking the lead on reaching out to local media outlets and coordinating the event schedule. I'll focus on contacting local officials and community members, as well as ensuring that the space is ready for the big day.

I've attached a draft of the invitation and press release for your review. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes.

Talk to you next week!

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA

attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Hi John,

It's great to hear from you! I'd be happy to discuss your IPC challenges.

It's a lightweight messaging library that simplifies the development of distributed systems and supports various communication patterns.

summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 
600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out 
because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to 
blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.  
it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break

Hey Jordan,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to you about an interesting case I came across recently. I've been working with a patient who has a rare pulmonary structure that I believe could have significant implications for our research on gas exchange efficiency.

The patient's lungs exhibit an unusual branching pattern of the bronchial tree, which seems to affect the distribution of airflow and gas exchange. I've attached some images and preliminary data for your review.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this case and how you think it might relate to our ongoing research. Do you think this could provide new insights into the relationship between pulmonary structure and gas exchange?

Subject: Re: Econometrics and Linguistics Collaboration

Javier,

Great suggestions about the statistical methods and potential corpora. I'll take a look at the list of options you send and let you know which ones I think would work best for our analysis.

Your point about making our paper accessible to both econometricians and linguists is well-taken. We should definitely plan to include clear explanations of the key concepts and methods from both fields. Perhaps we could even include a glossary of terms to help readers from each field understand the other's perspective.

I've been thinking more about the broader implications of our research. If we find evidence that economic factors influence language change, it could have important implications for language policy and planning. For example, it might suggest that policymakers should consider economic factors when designing language education programs or language preservation initiatives.

What do you think about these ideas? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the potential implications of our work.

Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan

Hi John,

Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan 
for your cost center - 105894.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 
direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that 
details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and 
a template for the 2001 plan.  

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you 
tomorrow:

1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?
2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?
3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?
4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want 
to plan for?
5) Are you expecting any promotions?
6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement 
agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?
7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?
8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?  If so, how much and where?
9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, 
monitors and software?
10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should 
plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)

My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished 
before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  
Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the 
meeting.

Thanks!
Suzanne

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Dear Emily,

I think your proposed format for the event sounds fantastic! It's a great balance of presentations, hands-on activities, and opportunities for engagement. I'm particularly excited about the Q&A session at the end, as it will give the audience a chance to delve deeper into the topics we cover and ask questions they may have.

I'll start putting together some resources and information on conservation genetics and wildlife immunology that you can use in your lesson plans. I'll also work on selecting a dataset that the students can use during the mini-workshop that showcases some of the key concepts and techniques we use in our research.

In the meantime, let's touch base again in a week or so to finalize the details of the event and make sure we're on track. I'll also reach out to the Greensboro Environmental Alliance to coordinate with them and ensure everything runs smoothly.

Thank you again for your enthusiasm and dedication to engaging your students in environmental issues. I'm confident that this event will be a great success and will inspire the next generation of scientists and conservationists!

Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out about this incredible opportunity. I'm thrilled to hear about the research project and the focus on the cardiovascular system. It's a fascinating area of study, and I'd be honored to work alongside you and the research team.

I completely agree that this project aligns perfectly with our interests and passion for understanding the human body's complexities. The prospect of contributing to the advancement of medical knowledge is truly exciting.

I think we've made some great progress, but I'd love to get your feedback on a few specific areas:

1. Do you think the mini-lessons on ethos, pathos, and logos are clear and engaging for middle schoolers? 
2. Do you have any suggestions for the collaborative peer review activity in Lesson 4?
3. Have you had a chance to test out the digital publishing platform we discussed? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Dear Alex,

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding this important case. As someone who is deeply committed to upholding the rule of law and protecting the public interest, I am eager to lend my expertise and support to your efforts.

From what you have described, it seems that there are a number of complex legal and constitutional issues at play here. In particular, I am concerned about the potential for political pressure to compromise the integrity of the disaster response efforts and the legal process.

To better understand the situation and provide you with the most effective guidance, I would need to review the relevant case files and legal documents. I would also like to discuss the specific concerns you have about the government agency's involvement and the potential for conflicts of interest.

If you are able to share this information with me, I would be happy to provide a detailed legal analysis and recommendations for how to proceed. I can also connect you with some of my colleagues who specialize in administrative law and government accountability, who may be able to offer additional insights and support.

Please let me know when would be a good time for us to discuss this further. I am available to meet in person or by phone, whichever is most convenient for you.

Thank you again for reaching out, and for your dedication to upholding the law and serving the public good.

Your idea for a collaborative project is brilliant! I'm fully on board and eager to contribute my knowledge of comparative anatomy and the scientific perspective on nature symbolism. I think this project has the potential to make a real impact in both our fields and beyond.

Let's start by defining the key themes and concepts we want to explore, and then we can create a detailed outline for the paper or educational resource. I'm happy to take on the tasks related to the scientific aspects and the analysis of anatomical symbolism.

I look forward to working with you on this exciting endeavor. Please let me know when you're available for a video call to discuss our next steps.

Jeff,

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

Phillip

Phillip,

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.

As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Subject: RE: Seeking advice on developing physics lesson plans for elementary students

Dear Maria,

Thank you so much for your thoughtful response and for sharing those fantastic resources! I really appreciate your insights on making science concepts relatable and tangible for young learners. The ideas you mentioned, like creating pinhole cameras and discussing real-world applications, are perfect examples of how to engage students and spark their curiosity.

I will definitely review the Next Generation Science Standards to ensure my lesson plans align with the expectations for each grade level. Your lesson plan templates will be incredibly helpful as I begin to structure my own materials.

I would love to set up a call to discuss potential collaborations and share more about my project. I'm aiming to create a series of lesson plans that integrate physics and math concepts, with a focus on hands-on activities and real-world applications. I think your expertise in elementary education and standards-based instruction will be invaluable as I develop these materials.

My availability is fairly flexible next week. If you could let me know a few times that work well for you, I'll be happy to schedule a call.

Thank you again for your willingness to share your knowledge and collaborate. I'm excited to work together to create engaging learning experiences for young students!

Hi Priya,

Thank you for your detailed response. It's fascinating to learn more about the challenges you face in designing and implementing a programming language for space-related computations. It sounds like there are indeed some valuable opportunities for collaboration between our fields.

I completely agree that incorporating sustainability considerations into the development process is crucial. From my perspective, this could involve ensuring that the language and tools are designed to minimize resource consumption, both in terms of computational resources and the physical resources required for space missions. It may also involve developing best practices and guidelines for sustainable software development in the space sector.

I'm available for a call next week, either Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning, depending on your schedule. Please let me know what works best for you, and I'll send over a meeting invite.

I look forward to diving deeper into these topics and exploring how we can work together to promote sustainability in our respective domains.

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Andy:
The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",corporate,No

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Sean,
The following are the contacts that have been made by Enron Media Services
with Enron Picture. The initial meeting, Enron Media Services was
represented by Mike Horning, Edward Ondarza and Steve Crumley.
We met with the following personnel from SPE:

- Allan Dick, VP Corporate Procurement
- Cherie Crane, SVP Media
- Joseph Foley, SVP Marketing
- Kathleen Shane, VP Finance
- Jennie Angelos, Director Business Planning
- Peter LaBrida, Manager Corporate Procurement

Mike has provided Allan with today's one-year fixed price swap for spot TV
media in NY, LA and Houston.  Mike expects feedback from Allan today on the
pricing and the Sony attendees from meeting.  The next meeting that Mike is
having is
11/1 with Allan Dick.

Could you do some investigation and find out what the feel is for the Enron
Media Services product offering and possible communicate to Sony Pictures
that there are revenue opportunities for Sony also.

Please give me a call when you have an opportunity.

Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well. As you know, we've been asked to co-teach the new interdisciplinary course on the economics of healthcare next semester. I think this is a great opportunity for us to combine our expertise and create a valuable learning experience for our students.

I was thinking we could meet next week to discuss the syllabus, reading materials, and our teaching responsibilities. Are you available on Tuesday afternoon, say around 3 pm? We could meet in my office or yours, whichever is more convenient for you.

Also, I wanted to share a recent paper I came across that might be relevant to our course. It's titled ""The Cost-Effectiveness of Telemedicine: A Systematic Review"" by Dr. Michael Johnson. I thought it might provide some interesting insights for our lectures.

Looking forward to hearing back from you and starting this exciting collaboration!

Ali,

The ""Bridge"" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one you 
want, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by Enron w/ ""Bridge"".  That 
spend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as one 
might hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is 
""Hardware"".  I am not sure that is the ""Bridge"" which Kathy Shaps is looking 
for the contract information (if any) on.  

That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a deal 
with (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse & 
Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, but 
perhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS 
may have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly, 
who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).  
You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the right 
person in EBS purchasing, if it's a ""buy on PO"" situation.

http://www.bridge.com/

http://www.webfn.com/cgi-bin/core.dll?i9=267&s144=index.txt&sfront=1&slogin=0&
sframeBust=undefined

Please check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the 
""Enron relationship"" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to 
look for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, 
if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with any 
company called ""Bridge"", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or some 
other ""Bridge"".  When I have more information, I'll call and/or e-mail you 
with an update.  I'll also copy Kathy and Kim.

Thank you,

Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Hey Ryan,

I'm so excited about our upcoming presentation at Westfield High School! I think it's a great opportunity to inspire the next generation to take action and make a difference in their communities.

I was thinking we could start by sharing some statistics on the impact of waste on the environment, and then dive into some practical tips for reducing waste at home and school. We could also include some interactive elements, like a recycling quiz or a mini-trash audit.

Hi Alex,

It was great meeting you at the ""Engaging Young Minds"" event last weekend. I was really impressed by your ideas for integrating cultural and musical education into your kindergarten curriculum. As I mentioned, I'm a curator at the Harborview Maritime Museum, and I'm always looking for ways to make our exhibits more accessible and engaging for children.

I think there could be a fantastic opportunity for collaboration between our organizations. I'd love to explore how we might bring the history of maritime navigation to life for your students through interactive learning modules that combine art, music, and history. Perhaps we could start by discussing some of your curriculum goals and brainstorm how our resources and expertise could support them.

Would you be available for a call next week to discuss this further? I'm excited about the potential for this partnership and would love to hear your thoughts.

The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you 
consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment 
and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be

Dear Dr. Johnson,

I hope you remember me - I'm Emily, the daughter of your old college friend, Sarah. I'm sure you're busy, but I was wondering if you might have some time to help me with my chemistry homework. I'm struggling a bit and could really use some guidance.

I know you're an environmental studies professor now, but I figured your science background might make you the perfect person to ask. If you have any time in the next few days, I'd really appreciate your help. Let me know if this is possible.

Thanks so much,

Hey David,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some exciting preliminary results from my latest research on subduction zones. As you know, I've been working on this project for a while now, and I think I've stumbled upon something significant that could challenge some of the established theories in our field.

I would love to get your input on my findings before I proceed further. Would you be interested in taking a look at my draft and providing some feedback? I understand if you're busy, but I really value your expertise and insights.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to send over the draft.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Subject: New research idea - selective logging and forest biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! I was just reading about the latest debates around selective logging in the Pacific Northwest and it got me thinking about the potential impacts on forest biodiversity. I know this is an issue we've both been following closely, and I was wondering if you might be interested in collaborating on a research project to investigate this further.

My initial idea is to combine field surveys with remote sensing data to assess the effects of selective logging on species composition and habitat structure in different forest types. I think this could be a really valuable contribution to the ongoing policy discussions and help inform more sustainable management practices.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing together. I'd be happy to discuss the details further and start brainstorming next steps.

Dear Haruki,

Thank you for your email. I completely agree with your suggestions for our presentation. Focusing on the main motifs and their evolution throughout history is a great way to showcase our research.

I think we should also include some examples of contemporary Japanese art that still incorporate these traditional motifs, to show how they continue to be relevant and meaningful today. We could discuss the works of some modern artists who are inspired by these motifs and how they reinterpret them in their own unique ways.

I'm also happy to work on creating a visually engaging PowerPoint presentation to accompany our talk. Let me know if you have any specific images or resources I should include.

I'm really looking forward to our trip to Kyoto and presenting our research together!

Subject: Epiphany Event Planning

Hi Robert,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the Epiphany event we're planning for the school. I've been thinking about the reenactment and the parade, and I had an idea that might make the parade extra special.

Since you're an engineer, would you be willing to create a special effect for the parade? I was thinking about having a star that lights up to guide the Magi, similar to the Star of Bethlehem. I think it would be a great way to make the parade more engaging for the children and help them understand the significance of the Magi's journey.

Let me know what you think about this idea. If you're interested, we can discuss the details and see if it's feasible given our timeline and budget.

Also, I've been researching traditional Spanish songs and prayers associated with the Epiphany. I'll send you the information I've found, and we can decide which ones to include in the event.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Jeff,

I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.

In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.

I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.

I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Phillip

I spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.
However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownership
interests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.
(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but she
has not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.

I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes the
transfer.  If it is acceptable please sign and fax to her directly at
830-372-5400.  Please fax to me also.

Thanks.

Subject: New Telescope Stargazing Session

Hey Jordan,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some exciting news with you. I finally took the plunge and bought a new telescope! It's a Celestron NexStar 8SE, and I can't wait to try it out.

Would you be interested in coming over to my place this weekend for a stargazing session? I think it would be a great opportunity to break in the new telescope and catch up on all things astronomy.

Let me know if you're available and what time works best for you.

Clear skies,

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the update! I'm glad to hear that we've made so much progress. I've taken a look at the data you sent over, and I think we can definitely use some historical mapping techniques to make the information more accessible.

One technique that comes to mind is the use of isarithmic maps, which use contour lines to represent the magnitude of a particular variable (in this case, the likelihood of geological events). This could be a great way to show the potential impact of climate change on different regions.

I've also been thinking about how we might be able to use our maps to help urban planners and emergency services prepare for potential disasters. If we can create maps that show the areas most at risk, it could be a valuable resource for those working to protect communities.

I'm excited to keep working on this project with you. Let me know if you want to set up a meeting to discuss our next steps.

Dear Alice,

Thank you for reaching out! I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation at the conference and found your work on Old English and Proto-Germanic languages equally fascinating. The idea of a collaborative project is very appealing, and I believe our combined expertise could lead to a unique and insightful paper.

I have been giving some thought to the potential structure and focus of our paper. One aspect that particularly interests me is the role of language in the negotiation of power dynamics between the British colonizers and the Indian population. We could examine how the adoption and adaptation of English by Indians both resisted and facilitated British control.

I would be delighted to work with you on this project and am happy to contribute my historical knowledge to complement your linguistic expertise. Please let me know your availability for a discussion to further develop our ideas.

2. Overview of previous research on theropod hunting strategies
3. Description of our fieldwork and data collection methods
4. Analysis of the fossil evidence indicating pack hunting behavior

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning 
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a 
lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a 
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will 
there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can 
answer that.

recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not

 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 
6

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill

I don't know what your need for brokerage services are, but Scott is nice enough as far as brokers go.  Personally, I am extremely pleased with the transition to online platforms and find that I can get 90%+ of my business done online.  If you have a need for brokers, Scott is a good choice.

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Hey Jane,

I hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last chatted. I wanted to reach out because I recently started a new job at HighPerf Systems, and I've been working on some really interesting projects related to high-performance computing and network optimization.

I'm currently trying to solve a problem with network throughput and latency in our new system, and I was wondering if you had any insights or suggestions. I know you've done a lot of work in this area, and I'd really appreciate your thoughts.

If you have a few minutes to spare, I'd love to hear your ideas. I'm also curious to learn more about what you've been up to lately. Are you still working on containerization and security for your company's cloud infrastructure? I'd be interested in hearing about any new techniques or tools you've been using.

Let me know if you're free for a virtual coffee chat sometime soon!

Emily,

Thank you for sharing those insights! It's fascinating to hear about the importance of personalization and adaptability in early language learning. In my research, I've been exploring ways to optimize memory management in educational software to create more responsive and adaptive learning experiences. I think there could be some great synergies between our work.

I'm particularly interested in understanding how young children engage with technology and what kinds of interactions and feedback are most effective for their learning. If you have any observations or examples from your classroom, I'd love to hear them.

I'm available for a video call next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon, if that works for you. Let me know what time would be best.

Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about my research. I am equally excited to learn about your work in weather forecasting and radar image analysis, and I believe that our respective expertise could indeed lead to a fruitful collaboration.

I would be delighted to meet for a virtual chat to discuss our research interests in more detail. As you mentioned, I am particularly interested in exploring how advances in weather forecasting technology could help us better understand the impact of weather on historical events like the Reconstruction era.

Based on your email, it seems that we both share a passion for environmental history and the impact of climate change on human societies. I would be very interested in discussing the possibility of co-authoring a paper on this topic and presenting our findings at the upcoming conference.

I completely agree with you. Metabolomics could be a powerful tool for optimizing the nutritional value of our food products. I'd be more than happy to collaborate with you on this project and share my knowledge of the technique.

I think a meeting is a great idea. How about we schedule it for next Tuesday at 10 AM? We can use the conference room on the third floor. I'll prepare a brief presentation on the basics of metabolomics and how it can be applied to our research.

In the meantime, feel free to send me any relevant data or samples you have from your prototype. I can start analyzing them using the metabolomics approach and see what insights we can gain.

I'm really excited about this collaboration and the potential impact it could have on our work. Let's make a difference in the world of food science!

Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.

Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

Jacques, 

Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:

Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.

If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.

Subject: RE: Need your expertise on teaching equilibrium

Hi Emily,

Great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about teaching equilibrium. It can be a tricky concept for sure. I remember struggling with it when I first started teaching general chemistry as well.

One thing that's helped me is using real-world examples to illustrate the concept. For instance, I like to use the example of a saturated solution of sugar in water. When the solution is saturated, the rate at which sugar is dissolving equals the rate at which it's crystallizing out of the solution. This helps students see that equilibrium isn't a static state, but rather a dynamic one where two opposing processes are happening at the same time.

I've also found that using a hands-on activity can be really helpful. I have my students create a mini ""equilibrium system"" using colored water, a separator, and some iodine. They can then observe the color change as the system reaches equilibrium. It's a simple but effective way to demonstrate the concept.

Feel free to use these ideas or adapt them as needed for your classroom. And please, let me know if there's anything else I can do to help. It's always great to collaborate with a fellow chemistry educator!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.  ",corporate,No

Subject: VaR

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?


Vince

Andy:
The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",corporate,No

Michael,

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  

It was worth a try.

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share some exciting news with you. I recently attended a seminar on the latest advancements in food preservation techniques, and I think you'll find it fascinating. The speakers discussed innovative methods that could significantly extend the shelf life of various food products without compromising their quality or nutritional value.

I remember our previous discussions about the challenges you've faced in your work related to food spoilage and shelf life. I thought these new techniques might be of interest to you and potentially applicable to your current projects.

Would you be available for a quick call next week to discuss this further? I'd be happy to share the seminar materials with you as well.

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

Hi David,

It was wonderful to meet you at the conference last week and learn about your research on sustainable agriculture and bioenergy. I was really intrigued by your talk on integrating biofuel production with crop and livestock systems. 

As I mentioned during our conversation, I believe there could be some exciting synergies between your work and my research on enzymatic synthesis of complex carbohydrates from waste biomass. I'd love to explore the potential for collaborating, perhaps on a joint publication or even a grant proposal.

I've attached a copy of the paper I presented at the conference, which outlines my recent results on using engineered enzymes to convert agricultural residues into valuable carbohydrate derivatives. I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts and any ideas you might have for how we could combine our expertise.

Let me know if you'd like to set up a call to discuss this further. I'm happy to make time whenever works best for you.

Subject: Website updates for the charity event

Hi Dr. Chen,

I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed during the last board meeting, I've been working on updating the community center's website to promote our upcoming charity event. I've created a new page dedicated to the event, where visitors can find information about the schedule, health-related activities, and ticket purchasing options.

Please take a look at the draft version of the page (https://www.ourcommunitycenter.org/charity-event) and let me know if you have any suggestions or changes you'd like me to make. I'd also appreciate it if you could share the link with your contacts in the medical community who might be interested in sponsoring or attending the event.

Looking forward to your feedback and collaboration on this important project!

Best regards,

$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve

Kristin,

Have you seen any studies associated with the opinions that the $12B is not enough.  I would like to see some calculations that multiply the net short by the power cost and compare that to the amounts collected through rates.

Subject:	California Update 5/22/01

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",corporate,Yes

Thank you for your reply.  I know you are doubly busy with your being on the 
road this week, just prior to a vacation.  Your answer below is perfect!  
Bob, you and your team have been very supportive of our efforts to assist EBS 
with BMC, and you have done all that we could have asked!  I wanted you to 
know that we really appreciate your support (I especially do, as a ""late 
arrival"" to this situation)!  Thank you again for all of the help!

Subject: Update

Bob, 

I understand from Thais that you're on the road for Enron, but soon you'll be 
""on the road for Bob"" - a well-deserved vacation coming up!  In light of your 
impending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check.

If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in your 
organization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for Net 
Works, would you support that?

I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followup 
calls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1.  IF Randy and Doug were 
likely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product), 
and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds to 
become available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would that 
be something you would support?  I am searching for a way to help EBS without 
impacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abide 
whatever you demand here.  

I hope to hear from you, either by telephone/voicemail, or e-mail; if you 
could do so prior to your vacation.

Thank you again for your help,

don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze 
like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash 
such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it 
might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really 
want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though.   
Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as

so many technicians bullshit  their way ""support at 5400-5600 but if it

Liam,

Your findings are incredible! The evidence of a massive volcanic eruption aligns perfectly with the historical records I've been analyzing. It's fascinating to see how the geological data supports the accounts of the ""great fire"" and its impact on the region.

I've been delving deeper into the political and social changes that followed the eruption, and I believe we have a compelling story to tell. The combination of your geological research and my historical insights could provide a new perspective on the role of natural disasters in shaping human history.

Let's schedule a call next Tuesday at 11 AM IST to discuss our findings and outline the structure of our paper. I'll send you a calendar invite.

I'm thrilled about the potential implications of our work and the opportunity to present our findings at the conference.

PRESSPLAY, MUSICNET: LEGAL, BUT NOT FOR MP3 PLAYERS

    This is so idiotic that I can't believe I'm
         writing a column about it, but here goes: You
         know those ""legal"" Napster sites the music
         industry is creating? Well, throw away your
         MP3 player, because it won't work with them.
         Are these people nuts?

    HOLIDAY WORM STRIKES... PCS W/DVD: HOT!... INTEL REVS UP...

    Think you've got the post-Thanksgiving
    blues? Try snacking on a worm to go with
    your leftovers. This weekend a computer
    worm caught holiday-sated folks off
    guard while they contemplated stuffing
    instead of security.

  WHY THE NEW POWERBOOK G4 IS A MAJOR FASHION VICTIM

   While Stephan's not a huge fan of the Titanium
         PowerBook G4, he thought he should give the
         newest model a try. What did he find? It sure
         looks nice, but it still isn't the greatest
         pro laptop out there.

My risk group frequently uses the New Counterparty label for internal 
counterparties that do not have a trading book.  This transaction was a hedge 
for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.  I'm not sure 
who the internal group is that did the transaction.  Dutch Quigley should be 
able to help.

A trade came across our morning report listed as a 'New Counterparty'.  It 
was about 17BCF Swap from Sep ""00  - Aug '07.  Can you give me some details 
on the counterparty.

Thank you,

Hi Ethan,

It's great to hear from you! I'd be more than happy to review your draft chapter and provide some feedback. I'm always looking for new resources to bring Texas history to life for my students, and I'm sure your book will be a fantastic addition to our curriculum.

As for your idea of giving a talk at Willow Creek High School, I think that's a great idea! I'm actually good friends with the head of the history department, Ms. Martinez. I'll reach out to her and see if we can coordinate something. It would be wonderful to have you back at our alma mater.

I'm attaching a few resources that I've found helpful in teaching Texas history. I hope you find them useful in your research.

Let me know when you'll be in town, and we can grab coffee and catch up properly.

Best,
Olivia",research,No

There is no John Taylor at Ocean, and I don't remember the other name

I found the article in the Baltimore Sun.  Since when are you VP of natural

I'm meeting the girls at Saba tonight in the event you don't have plans
and want to join us.

Daryl,

Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.  This

The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are

Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Subject:	Please Reply by Wednesday, 8/22 -- Draft Rehearing Request -- FERC Reporting Requirements for California Sales

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Alex,

Thank you so much for offering to connect me with members of the deaf community for my research project. I really appreciate your help and support. I'll be eagerly awaiting any introductions you can make.

Your idea for a collaborative workshop or presentation is fantastic! I think it would be a great way to raise awareness about the important issues we discussed. I'm definitely interested in exploring this further. Let's set up a time to brainstorm ideas and plan next steps.

I'm excited to continue our collaboration and see what we can achieve together. It's amazing how our seemingly disparate fields can come together to create something impactful.

Thanks again for your support and enthusiasm. I'll be in touch soon to schedule a time to chat.

All the best,

Sandra,

What a pleasant surprise to hear from you! I'm so glad that workshop rekindled your interest in our potential collaboration. I've been mulling it over ever since our initial conversations and I have to say, I'm pretty excited about the idea you proposed.

A pilot study on a Koryo dynasty herbal remedy's immunological effects? That's fascinating! I've actually been doing some research into the historical use of various herbs during that time period. I think I have some good leads on promising candidates we could test.

I'm definitely on board to co-author a grant proposal with you. I think this could be the start of a really fruitful collaboration. The interdisciplinary workshop series sounds like the perfect place to showcase our findings.

I'm attaching a draft of the study design I've been sketching out. Take a look and let me know what you think. I'm happy to refine it further. 

I'm looking forward to working together on this! Let me know when you want to set up a call to discuss the grant proposal.

Best,

Hey Adam:
sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think 
you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way 
to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get 
close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas 
structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in

Hi John,

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its
been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened.
But the most important thing has been my decision to join
Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have
time please let me know if you know of anything.

Thanks,

Adam Bayer

Subject: RE: Exciting new find on the Alaska Purchase

Elena,

This is a fantastic discovery! The letter provides a fascinating glimpse into the Russian perspective on the negotiations and could really strengthen our argument about the broader geopolitical context of the Alaska Purchase.

I think we should consider restructuring our lecture to place more emphasis on the diplomatic negotiations themselves, using this letter as a key piece of evidence. We could start with an overview of the geopolitical situation, then dive into the specific negotiations, highlighting this new source, and conclude with the implications of the purchase for Russo-American relations and European power dynamics.

What do you think? I'm happy to draft an outline for the new structure if you agree.

Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,

Michael,

I'm thrilled to hear about your enthusiasm for this opportunity! I believe that your expertise and insights will be invaluable to our research efforts.

The research center will be equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including advanced imaging technology, high-throughput screening capabilities, and access to a large biorepository of HIV samples. The sabbatical terms include a competitive salary, relocation assistance, and resources for research expenses.

As for the research focus, I envision our collaboration centering on the development of novel vaccine strategies, particularly focusing on broadly neutralizing antibodies and T-cell based approaches. However, I am open to discussing other ideas that align with our shared interests and expertise.

I would be happy to arrange a video call to discuss this further and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know your availability in the coming weeks, and we can set up a meeting.

I look forward to the possibility of working together and making significant strides in the fight against HIV.

Dear Ananda,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we're in the process of putting together a new exhibit on Buddhist art and iconography, and I would be remiss if I didn't reach out to you for your invaluable insights and expertise.

I've attached a draft of the exhibit layout and descriptions for your review. I would be grateful for any feedback, suggestions, or corrections you may have. Your deep knowledge of Buddhist history and scripture is unmatched, and I want to ensure that our exhibit accurately reflects the rich cultural and religious significance of these pieces.

Additionally, I wanted to let you know that I'm considering a career change and am thinking about moving into museum curation. I've always admired your work and dedication to sharing the beauty and importance of Asian art with the public, and I would be honored if you would consider mentoring me as I explore this new path.

Thank you in advance for your time and guidance. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the exhibit and discussing my potential career transition further.

Subject: RE: Faulkner, Thermodynamics, and Power Generation

Ava,

I hope you're doing well. Thank you for reaching out and considering me for this collaboration. I'm truly honored and excited about the prospect of working together on this project. Your research on Faulkner's use of symbolism to explore power and energy is fascinating, and I believe my background in thermodynamics and power generation systems could indeed provide a unique perspective.

I would love to meet up and discuss the possibility of collaborating on a presentation for the conference. Perhaps we could explore how the principles of thermodynamics and power generation can be seen as symbolic representations in Faulkner's works, and vice versa. I think this could lead to a thought-provoking discussion that bridges the gap between literature and engineering.

Let me know when you're available to meet, and we can start brainstorming ideas for our presentation.

Best regards,
Liam",research,No

Mr. Thompson:

Thank-you for your time this morning as we reviewed progress on the=20
Kinko's/Enron relationship and discussed how we might move forward with the=
=20
appropriate individuals at Kinko's who could help us define ""value=20

=20
As we mentioned, we would like to have a conference call and/or meeting wit=
h=20
Kinko's ""solutions architects"" who could work with us on further defining =
=20
broadband and pulp & paper initatives.  If these discussions were held befo=
re=20
the holidays, this would enable us to prepare both for the Experience Enron=
=20
event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent=
=20
executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication=20
transit possibilities with kinkos.com and other broadband-related questions=
=20
would be helpful in this endeavor.  Often, this information comes to us=20
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO.  =20
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the=
=20
CFO) could address the following types of questions regarding Kinko's paper=
=20
usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes fro=
m=20
the October 6th meeting as background information of our discussions.

Thank-you for your help.  I can be reached at:  #(713)-345-6541 and look=20

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Hi Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share with you a fascinating discovery I made recently that I believe could have significant implications for the culinary world.

While researching the chemical properties of a rare Peruvian root vegetable, I found that it contains unique compounds that could potentially revolutionize the way chefs approach texture and mouthfeel in dishes. I would love to discuss this further with you and explore the possibilities of a collaboration.

Are you available for a call next week to discuss this in more detail? I'm excited to hear your thoughts and expertise on this matter.

Hi Ravi,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the progress on the Telangana movement website. We've made great strides in the past few months, and I couldn't be happier with the work you've done so far.

I have a few questions and updates to discuss with you:

1. Have you had a chance to look into the interactive timeline feature we discussed last week? I think it would be a great addition to the site.

2. I've received some new historical documents that I'd like to incorporate into the site. I'll send them over to you shortly.

3. I was wondering if we could set up a call next week to discuss the overall layout and design of the site. I have a few ideas I'd like to bounce off you.

Let me know your thoughts on these items and when you're available for a call next week.

Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! As we approach the completion of the Riverdale Community Center project, I wanted to touch base with you regarding the grand opening event. We've made tremendous progress, and I believe it's time to start planning the big reveal.

I was thinking we could hold the event on the weekend of June 15th, which would give us enough time to finalize the remaining details and ensure everything is perfect. What do you think about inviting some local officials, media, and community members to showcase the space and its features?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the event planning and any suggestions you might have. Let's touch base early next week to discuss further and divide up the tasks.

Please let me know if you have any specific topics or techniques you'd like to discuss during your visit. I'm happy to prepare any materials or demonstrations in advance.

Subject: RE: New Project Proposal - Online Health Encyclopedia

Hi Michael,

Thanks for your quick response and for being open to discussing this project further. I'm glad you're as excited about it as I am!

Next Tuesday afternoon would be perfect for me. How about we schedule our call for 2:00 PM EST? Let me know if that works for you.

In terms of topics, I think we should focus on the most common health concerns and conditions, as well as general health and wellness information. We can create a more detailed outline during our call.

I look forward to our discussion and to working together on this project.

Best regards,

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Philip,

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

Mrs. Johnson,

Thank you so much for your email. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me understand this material better. I've been feeling pretty anxious about the upcoming test and struggling to grasp the concepts.

I would love to take a look at that online resource you mentioned. Interactive visualizations sound like they could be really helpful for me to see the connections between molecular orbitals and the periodic table.

If you have time, I would definitely appreciate going over it together. I want to do well on this test and feel more confident in my understanding of chemistry.

Thank you again for your help and support. It means a lot to me.

Hey David,

I've been thinking more about our chemistry and art project, and I'm really excited to get started! I think it's a great opportunity for our students to learn about the science behind color and chemical reactions while also expressing their creativity.

I was wondering if you had any thoughts on what specific chemical reactions we could use for the project? I'm thinking we could do something with pH indicators or maybe even a volcano-like reaction. Let me know what you think!

Also, I wanted to set up a time for us to meet and discuss the logistics of the project. I'm free this Friday after school if that works for you.

Looking forward to working together on this!

Hey Emily,

Great to hear from you! I'm thrilled to learn about the advancements in gene editing technology. It's fascinating to think about the potential implications for space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life.

Speaking of which, I recently attended a lecture by Dr. Sarah Miller, a prominent astrophysicist. She discussed the latest advancements in telescopic technology and how it's enabling us to detect potentially habitable exoplanets. It's an exciting time for sure!

I've been thinking about the upcoming World Science Conference in Denver. Would you be interested in attending? It covers various fields, including genetics and astrophysics. It could be a great opportunity to catch up in person and attend some sessions together.

Let me know what you think!

Hi Emily,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm glad you enjoyed the presentation and found the connection between pollinator conservation and community resilience compelling. I completely agree that combining our expertise could lead to some fantastic outreach opportunities.

I'm particularly excited about the idea of creating educational programs for local schools. Empowering the younger generation with knowledge about disaster preparedness and the importance of pollinators is crucial for building a more resilient and sustainable future.

I would love to chat next week to brainstorm ideas and discuss potential collaborations. Tuesday afternoon works well for me. How about we meet at the Green Leaf Café at 2 pm? It's a great spot for brainstorming sessions, and they have an excellent selection of pollinator-friendly beverages!

Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Thank you so much for the resources, Mr. Thompson! I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out. The Khan Academy videos were really helpful for understanding the periodic table better. 

I do have a couple specific questions about the worksheet if you have a minute:

1. How do I know which elements will form ionic or covalent bonds?
2. What's the difference between single, double, and triple bonds?
3. How do I know how many electrons each element will gain or lose?

If you have any tips for those questions, that would be a huge help. Thank you again for all your help!

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Hi Emily,

I'm so glad you reached out! I've been equally excited about our project and the potential impact it could have on our students. I'd love to meet up on Saturday afternoon to discuss our next steps. The local café sounds perfect – let's say 2 pm?

I've been thinking about the National Education Conference and how we can best present our findings. I think it's crucial that we emphasize the practical applications of our work and how it can help students navigate the complex world of politics and decision-making. What do you think?

I'll see you on Saturday!

Best,
Oliver",research,No
