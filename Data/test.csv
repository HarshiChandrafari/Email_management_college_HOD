I'm thrilled to have your expertise on board!I've attached a draft of my initial research on the linguistic roots of words related to paper and folding. As you'll see, I've focused primarily on Old English and Proto-Germanic terms, but I believe that incorporating the history and techniques of origami could help shed light on how these words have evolved over time.Please let me know if you have any suggestions or additional resources that could help strengthen the article. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the specific terms used in origami and how they've influenced the English language.I'm available to discuss our ideas further next week, if that works for you.

Keep up the good work.""Cooper, Sean"" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PM  Per Sharehttp://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.htmlTuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern TimeCompany Press ReleaseSOURCE: El Paso Energy CorporationEl Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per ShareHOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) todayannounced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earningsper share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per shareof one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstandingfor the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjustedearnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the secondquarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 millionin the year-ago period.EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in thequarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance inour other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' saidWilliam A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso EnergyCorporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolioof flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued toaccelerate in the second quarter.''For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per shareincreased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the firstsix months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excludingnon-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515million in the year-ago period.Second Quarter Business Segment ResultsThe Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in thesecond quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last yearand $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gasand power portfolio developed over the past several years is creatingsignificant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhancedtrading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesalecustomer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company'soff-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributedto the record second-quarter performance.The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBITto $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higherrealized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following thereorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices forthe quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, fromthe year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per dayand oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was dueprimarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together withthe acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillionBtu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural GasTransmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million comparedwith an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of costsavings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlementfiled in March.The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 millioncompared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects inBrazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company'sinvestment in the Philippines.Telecom Update``We have made substantial progress in the development of ourtelecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso MerchantEnergy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in buildingbusinesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our MerchantEnergy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in thetelecommunications marketplace.''Quarterly DividendThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share onthe company's outstanding common stock.

The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based ventureinitiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to golive soon afterwards.   While market transparency will increase as dealers used toover-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, usersof the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, JeffreySprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals bothcounterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get theability to manage your own counterparties.   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and putin the credit terms under which you will do business.""   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a""giant matrix"" within the system.   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't surethey have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals youcan't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currentlyaware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase markettransparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers whofall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.

TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believestrading over the Internet could boost trading profits.""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that apaperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off giventhat dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearingsystems, as they do in current OTC systems.   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties willreceive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through thoseplayers' own risk management systems.   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its ownclearing system.  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There mightbe some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now existspeer to peer.""  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurredexcept those associated with trading. Membership is open to anycommercial market participant.

44,1583,"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  If we get two low injections, watch out.   	Enron North America Corp.			  	John,I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation. However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather. I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.Thanks,Frank",corporate,No

59,1001,"Ned,Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

80,1842,"---------------------- 12:28 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.

85,144,"---------------------- 05:50 PM ---------------------------   	Enron North America Corp.			 Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT Phillip et al.,I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.

109,1641,"Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns.  What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

In fact, I recently came across some intriguing data from the 1980s while going through the archives here at Mauna Loa. It's about a particularly strong solar flare and its impact on Earth's ionosphere. I think it could be a perfect case study for our paper.I'm attaching the data I found. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss how to incorporate it into the paper.Also, I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference in San Diego!

I've definitely noticed the same issue in my classes, and I agree that we need to find a better way to explain electron configuration in the context of molecular orbital theory.I've been doing some research, and I came across a few resources that might be helpful.

185,178,"Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.KenIndigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much.  Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.    WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003 Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks Devon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debt  General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines Pioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure    *Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. ""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.",student,No

199,256,"---------------------- 02:16 PM ---------------------------Richard Burchfield10/06/2000 06:59 AM Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PM Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.

201,1992,"<email>Hi Emily,Thanks for your email! I love the ideas you've suggested for the literacy event. The student-led dramatic reading and the ""readers' theater"" performance are sure to be hits with the students and their families. I also like the idea of having a creative writing station and a bookmark-making station to engage the attendees in hands-on activities.Your suggestion to divide the responsibilities is great! I'm happy to take charge of the creative writing and bookmark-making stations. I think it's a good balance of our strengths and interests.I have a few more ideas to add to the mix:1. A ""book swap"" where students can bring gently used books to trade with their peers2. A ""story walk"" where pages of a book are displayed around the school grounds, and families can take a stroll while reading the story together3. A ""costume corner"" where students can dress up as their favorite book charactersLet me know what you think of these ideas, and we can finalize the plans soon.I'm excited to collaborate with you on this event and showcase the amazing work our students have been doing in our language arts program!Best,Sarah",research,No

I agree that the correlation between the distribution of volcanic centers and Io's tidal deformation is too strong to ignore.I've started cross-referencing the Juno data with the Galileo data, and the pattern holds up. In fact, I think I've found some additional evidence that supports your findings.I've attached a document with my preliminary analysis and some suggestions for strengthening the paper. I think we should also consider discussing the potential implications for other tidally heated moons, like Europa and Enceladus.I'm happy to take the lead on revising the paper based on your draft and my analysis. Shall we aim to submit this to Nature Geoscience?

205,1362,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.

Any insights you can provide on their meanings and implications would be incredibly helpful.Regarding your upcoming lecture, I have a few suggestions that might help make your ideas more accessible to a general audience:1. Use analogies and metaphors to relate complex concepts to everyday experiences. For example, you could compare the expansion of the universe to the stretching of a rubber band or the growth of a balloon.2. Employ visual aids like diagrams, animations, or demonstrations to illustrate your points. Visual representations can help bridge the gap between abstract ideas and concrete understanding.3. Break down your lecture into smaller, manageable chunks and provide clear transitions between each section. This will help your audience follow your train of thought and retain the information more easily.4. Encourage questions and engagement from the audience. Allowing time for discussion and clarification can help ensure that your message is being understood and can also provide valuable feedback for future presentations.I'd be happy to discuss these suggestions further or provide additional guidance as you prepare your lecture.On a personal note, I couldn't help but notice that you mentioned attending Weston College in your bio.

Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation.

Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)?

239,857,"Jim,Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.Phillip -----Original Message-----Sent:	Tuesday, November 20, 2001 8:56 AMPhillip,Hope you are doing well this week, and have great plans for Turkeyday!!We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our'83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping!Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr leaseoriginally. The other two are new.The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long.

Answe=r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=nd three touchdowns last weekend.

I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players= like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=ig game.  =09  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers= will be inconsistent at best.

I'll take a look at the list of options you send and let you know which ones I think would work best for our analysis.Your point about making our paper accessible to both econometricians and linguists is well-taken. We should definitely plan to include clear explanations of the key concepts and methods from both fields. Perhaps we could even include a glossary of terms to help readers from each field understand the other's perspective.I've been thinking more about the broader implications of our research. If we find evidence that economic factors influence language change, it could have important implications for language policy and planning.

If so, what level of person?2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for?5) Are you expecting any promotions?6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies?

261,1670,"---------------------- 01:29 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, ""Claudia L. Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

I'm particularly excited about the Q&A session at the end, as it will give the audience a chance to delve deeper into the topics we cover and ask questions they may have.I'll start putting together some resources and information on conservation genetics and wildlife immunology that you can use in your lesson plans. I'll also work on selecting a dataset that the students can use during the mini-workshop that showcases some of the key concepts and techniques we use in our research.In the meantime, let's touch base again in a week or so to finalize the details of the event and make sure we're on track. I'll also reach out to the Greensboro Environmental Alliance to coordinate with them and ensure everything runs smoothly.Thank you again for your enthusiasm and dedication to engaging your students in environmental issues.

As someone who is deeply committed to upholding the rule of law and protecting the public interest, I am eager to lend my expertise and support to your efforts.From what you have described, it seems that there are a number of complex legal and constitutional issues at play here. In particular, I am concerned about the potential for political pressure to compromise the integrity of the disaster response efforts and the legal process.To better understand the situation and provide you with the most effective guidance, I would need to review the relevant case files and legal documents. I would also like to discuss the specific concerns you have about the government agency's involvement and the potential for conflicts of interest.If you are able to share this information with me, I would be happy to provide a detailed legal analysis and recommendations for how to proceed. I can also connect you with some of my colleagues who specialize in administrative law and government accountability, who may be able to offer additional insights and support.Please let me know when would be a good time for us to discuss this further.

279,162,"Jeff,Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st Lien   473,5002nd Lien  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st Lien    47,2922nd Lien   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.Phillip",student,No

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",student,No

301,1151,"Andy:The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money.  Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",corporate,No

308,1566,"Ali,The ""Bridge"" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one you want, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by Enron w/ ""Bridge"".  That spend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as one might hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is ""Hardware"".  I am not sure that is the ""Bridge"" which Kathy Shaps is looking for the contract information (if any) on.  That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a deal with (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse & Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, but perhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS may have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly, who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).  You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the right person in EBS purchasing, if it's a ""buy on PO"" situation.http://www.bridge.com/http://www.webfn.com/cgi-bin/core.dll?i9=267&s144=index.txt&sfront=1&slogin=0&sframeBust=undefinedPlease check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the ""Enron relationship"" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to look for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with any company called ""Bridge"", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or some other ""Bridge"".

311,1392,"Reagan,I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?  Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.

312,650,"---------------------- 12:28 PM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.

A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

I know this is an issue we've both been following closely, and I was wondering if you might be interested in collaborating on a research project to investigate this further.My initial idea is to combine field surveys with remote sensing data to assess the effects of selective logging on species composition and habitat structure in different forest types.

328,2619,"<email>Dear Haruki,Thank you for your email. I completely agree with your suggestions for our presentation. Focusing on the main motifs and their evolution throughout history is a great way to showcase our research.I think we should also include some examples of contemporary Japanese art that still incorporate these traditional motifs, to show how they continue to be relevant and meaningful today. We could discuss the works of some modern artists who are inspired by these motifs and how they reinterpret them in their own unique ways.I'm also happy to work on creating a visually engaging PowerPoint presentation to accompany our talk.

329,2290,"<email>Hi Robert,I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the Epiphany event we're planning for the school. I've been thinking about the reenactment and the parade, and I had an idea that might make the parade extra special.Since you're an engineer, would you be willing to create a special effect for the parade? I was thinking about having a star that lights up to guide the Magi, similar to the Star of Bethlehem. I think it would be a great way to make the parade more engaging for the children and help them understand the significance of the Magi's journey.Let me know what you think about this idea. If you're interested, we can discuss the details and see if it's feasible given our timeline and budget.Also, I've been researching traditional Spanish songs and prayers associated with the Epiphany. I'll send you the information I've found, and we can decide which ones to include in the event.Looking forward to hearing back from you.Best regards,Emily",research,No
330,764,"Jeff,I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.Phillip -----Original Message-----Sent:	Tuesday, June 12, 2001 3:25 PMI spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownershipinterests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.(per her attorneys advice).  She is ready to sign the settlement, but shehas not been able to talk to her lawyer who is tied up in court.I have attached a Word file with the a letter to them which authorizes thetransfer.

335,2847,"<email>Hi Alex,Thanks for the update! I'm glad to hear that we've made so much progress. I've taken a look at the data you sent over, and I think we can definitely use some historical mapping techniques to make the information more accessible.One technique that comes to mind is the use of isarithmic maps, which use contour lines to represent the magnitude of a particular variable (in this case, the likelihood of geological events). This could be a great way to show the potential impact of climate change on different regions.I've also been thinking about how we might be able to use our maps to help urban planners and emergency services prepare for potential disasters. If we can create maps that show the areas most at risk, it could be a valuable resource for those working to protect communities.I'm excited to keep working on this project with you.

Electricgeneration demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2bcf/d out of market.

369,2069,"<email>Hi Emily,Great to hear from you! I'm glad you reached out about teaching equilibrium. It can be a tricky concept for sure. I remember struggling with it when I first started teaching general chemistry as well.One thing that's helped me is using real-world examples to illustrate the concept. For instance, I like to use the example of a saturated solution of sugar in water. When the solution is saturated, the rate at which sugar is dissolving equals the rate at which it's crystallizing out of the solution. This helps students see that equilibrium isn't a static state, but rather a dynamic one where two opposing processes are happening at the same time.I've also found that using a hands-on activity can be really helpful. I have my students create a mini ""equilibrium system"" using colored water, a separator, and some iodine. They can then observe the color change as the system reaches equilibrium. It's a simple but effective way to demonstrate the concept.Feel free to use these ideas or adapt them as needed for your classroom. And please, let me know if there's anything else I can do to help. It's always great to collaborate with a fellow chemistry educator!Best,Michael",research,No

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the veryviabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share undereithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under CompanyA,and so on.     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine thepricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the explorationprojectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over priceoffersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?     $______ per/share",student,No

This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                     code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince",student,No
379,1601,"Andy:The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money.  Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",corporate,No

Here are the main points from their conversation1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3.	New Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",corporate,Yes

In light of your impending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check.If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in your organization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for Net Works, would you support that?I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followup calls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1.  IF Randy and Doug were likely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product), and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds to become available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would that be something you would support?  I am searching for a way to help EBS without impacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abide whatever you demand here.  I hope to hear from you, either by telephone/voicemail, or e-mail; if you could do so prior to your vacation.Thank you again for your help,Jeff YoungfleshJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716",corporate,No

It's fascinating to see how the geological data supports the accounts of the ""great fire"" and its impact on the region.I've been delving deeper into the political and social changes that followed the eruption, and I believe we have a compelling story to tell. The combination of your geological research and my historical insights could provide a new perspective on the role of natural disasters in shaping human history.Let's schedule a call next Tuesday at 11 AM IST to discuss our findings and outline the structure of our paper.

437,1939,"<email>Elena,This is a fantastic discovery! The letter provides a fascinating glimpse into the Russian perspective on the negotiations and could really strengthen our argument about the broader geopolitical context of the Alaska Purchase.I think we should consider restructuring our lecture to place more emphasis on the diplomatic negotiations themselves, using this letter as a key piece of evidence. We could start with an overview of the geopolitical situation, then dive into the specific negotiations, highlighting this new source, and conclude with the implications of the purchase for Russo-American relations and European power dynamics.What do you think? I'm happy to draft an outline for the new structure if you agree.Best,James",research,No

455,183,"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/dNew Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas SelectWindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.

Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.Phillip Allen",corporate,No

497,2219,"George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment  What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?  By whom? What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction  When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names?These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn asmuch as possible from the process.Phillip",research,No

499,2743,"<email>Hi Emily,I'm so glad you reached out! I've been equally excited about our project and the potential impact it could have on our students. I'd love to meet up on Saturday afternoon to discuss our next steps. The local café sounds perfect – let's say 2 pm?I've been thinking about the National Education Conference and how we can best present our findings. I think it's crucial that we emphasize the practical applications of our work and how it can help students navigate the complex world of politics and decision-making. What do you think?I'll see you on Saturday!Best,Oliver",research,No
